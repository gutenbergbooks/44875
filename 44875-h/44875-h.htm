<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<h4>
GAZELLES AND MIDGES&mdash;THE MIDGE'S WINGS ARE SINGED.
</h4>

<p>
Born an Irishman, the son of an Irishwoman;
educated in Scotland, the country of my father, an
ancient mariner, who, as master and supercargo, had
sailed his own ship for many years in the Virginia
trade; removed to England at the age of seventeen,
in consequence of his death; I had, by the time I
arrived at majority, passed four years of my mercantile
apprenticeship in my paternal uncle's counting-house,
an extensive merchant in that modern Tyre,
the enterprising town of Liverpool; during which
period, young as I was, I had already made four voyages
in different vessels of his to foreign parts&mdash;to the
West Indies, the Brazils, the Costa Firme, and the
United States of America.
</p>

<p>
Being naturally a rambling, harumscarum sort of
a young chap, this sort of life jumped better with my
disposition than being perched on the top of a tall
mahogany tripod, poring over invoices, daybooks,
journals, and ledgers, with the shining ebony-coloured
desk jammed into the pit of my stomach below,
and its arbour of bright brass rods constantly perverting
the integrity of my curls above; so at the period
when the scene opens, I had with much ado prevailed
on my uncle to let me proceed once more on a cruise,
instead of a senior clerk, in charge of two of his ships,
bound to the African coast, to trade for ivory and
gold dust, and to fill up with palm oil and hardwood
timbers.
</p>

<p>
I had no small difficulty in carrying this point, as
the extreme insalubrity of the climate, the chance of
being plundered by the semi-piratical foreign slavers,
to say nothing of the danger of a treacherous attack
on the part of the natives themselves, weighed heavily
against my going in my worthy uncle's mind; but I
had set my heart on it, and where "there's a will,
there's a way."
</p>

<p>
I will not conceal, however, that after all, when it
came to the point, I do not believe he would have
allowed me to depart, had it not been for a prank of
mine, which put him into a towering passion with me
about this time.
</p>

<p>
On the occasion of a rejoicing for one of our great
victories, being hand-and-glove with all the skippers
and mates of the vessels belonging to the concern, I
smuggled up to our house on Everton Terrace,
unknown to my uncle, two boat guns, six-pounder
carronades, and a lot of fire-works, by bribing the brewer's
man to carry them for me in his cart.  Having
achieved this part of my plan, with the aid of two
young tars, I contrived to mount the guns in the
summer-house, immediately beneath the dining-room
window; and having loaded them, I set fire to slow
matches, fitted to the touch-holes, just as the dinner
bell rang; and then calmly took my place at table,
facing mine uncle.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman was rather a quiet-going codger,
and during meals seldom annoyed his neighbours with
too much conversation&mdash;in the present case, he had
eaten his soup, his bit of fish, and was just raising his
first glass of wine to his lips&mdash;when bang went one
of my carronades, and smash fell the glass&mdash;the
madeira flowing all down his lap.  He had not recovered
his equanimity, when bang went gun No. 2, and up
shot a whole constellation of rockets and Roman
candles, from the garden, whereat he fairly sprang off
his chair, as if the explosion had taken place in the
cushion of it, or he had been hoisted out of his socket
by some sort of catamaran.
</p>

<p>
His first impulse was to run to the open window;
whiz! a <i>live</i> rocket, or large squib, I forget which, flew
in over his shoulder, and nearly popped down the throat
of the old serving-man, who stood like a statue open
mouthed before the sideboard, petrified with astonishment;
as it was, it scorched the powdered curl over
his left ear, missing his head by a mere hair's breadth.
</p>

<p>
The guns I could account for, but the erratic course
of this missile surprised me exceedingly.  At one fell
swoop, it had cleared the sideboard of glasses,
decanters, silver waiters, and the sinumbra lamp; driven
my revered uncle to the top of the table for refuge;
and then, as if still unsatisfied with all this mischief,
it began to jump about under it, blazing and hissing
like a fiery serpent, first in this corner, then
under that chair; while old Peregrine, the waiting-man
(whose ice had at length thawed), and I were
dancing after it; knocking our heads together, and
breaking our shins against chairs and the edges of the
table, making glasses and decanters ring again, in a
vain endeavour to seize hold of the stick.  The row
soon brought up the other servants, groom, cook,
housemaid, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., towards whom, as if possessed
with some spirit of mischief, it fizzed through the door,
in its transit, nearly taking one of the female domestics
in reverse, whereat they all began to scream as if
they had been murdered; then up stairs it rattled, as if
desirous of visiting the drawing-room floor, poking
its snout into every cranny, hissing and wriggling
its tail, and putting the entire array to flight with
its vagaries.  It was too absurd to see a whole
household of grown people thus chasing a live sky-rocket
like so many children&mdash;"up stairs, down stairs, and
in my lady's chamber"&mdash;so presently we were all,
excepting the rocket itself, brought to a stand still, by
fits of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Although it was clear the heroic firework was not
to be captured alive, yet, at length, like the vapouring
of a passionate man, it spluttered itself out, and was
captured, stick and all, by the old cook, whose
propriety it had invaded; and I returned to the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
My uncle had by this time reseated himself at the
table, looking as black as thunder, with old Peregrine
planted once more behind his chair, as stiff as if he had
literally swallowed the rocketstick.  I sat down,
feeling not a little awkward; the dead silence becoming
every moment more and more irksome.  The old
gentleman seemed to suffer under this, as well as
myself, and to have come to the conclusion that it would
be more sociable, even to break out into a regular
scold, than hold his tongue any longer.
</p>

<p>
"So, Master Benjamin, a new piece of practical
wit of yours, I presume."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, my dear sir, I am very sorry&mdash;the guns
I plead guilty to; but who can have fired the rockets?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;as if you did not know"&mdash;quoth uncle Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, uncle, I do not, unless the fusees have
caught from the wadding of these cursed guns;"
which, in fact, was the case&mdash;"I am sure I wish they
had been at the bottom of the Mersey since they have
made you angry, uncle."
</p>

<p>
There was another awful pause&mdash;during which, in
came a message from Mr Pigwell, one of the neighbours,
to ask if any accident had occurred&mdash;-"No no,"
said uncle Peter testily&mdash;"no accident, only a small
mistake."
</p>

<p>
Another dead lull&mdash;presently the old servant, who
had gone to the lobby to deliver the message, returned
into the room, and as he placed a fresh bottle of wine
on the table, he said&mdash;"The man says Mrs Pigwell
has got a sad fright, sir&mdash;taken in labour, sir."
</p>

<p>
"There, Master Benjamin, there&mdash;I am sure I
wish you had gone to the coast of Africa before this
had happened&mdash;I was an old soft hearted fool to stand
in the way."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear uncle, it is not too late yet"&mdash;said
I, a good deal piqued.  Not a word from him&mdash;"I am
sorry to see you have taken such offence where none
was meant.  It was a piece of folly, I admit, and I am
sincerely sorry for it."  Still silent&mdash;"Jennings is still
at anchor down below&mdash;I can easily be ready
to-morrow, and there is no appearance of the wind
changing&mdash;so, pray, do let me go."
</p>

<p>
"You may go to the devil, sir, for me"&mdash;and off he
started, fizzing, worse than the rocket itself, with rage
to his dressing-room, where he often used to pass an
hour or two in the evenings alone.
</p>

<p>
I sat still, guzzling my wine in great wrath.&mdash;Enter
Peregrine again.  I was always a favourite
with the old fellow, although he had been seriously
angry at first, when he saw that my absurd prank had
put his old master so cruelly out.  Now, however,
I perceived he was anxious to make up for it.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, Master Benjamin, your uncle is in such a
taking you never se'ed&mdash;why, do you know, the first
thing he did when he went to his dressing-room was
to hang his wig on the lighted candle, instead of the
pillar of the looking glass; and then we were all in
darkness, you see&mdash;so, in groping my way out, I
popped my foot into the hot water in the foot-pail
that he had ordered up, and this scalded me so, that,
forgetting where I was, I could not help swearing a
bit, Master Benjamin;&mdash;on which he opened the door,
and thrust me out, neck and crop, calling me a
blasphemous old villain&mdash;although we all know he is not
slack at a good rousing oath himself when his bristles
are up; but to call me an old blasphemer&mdash;<i>me!</i> who
have sarved him faithfully for thirty years, in various
parts of the world&mdash;a blasphemous old villain, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
I saw no more of my uncle that night, and when we
met next morning at breakfast, I was rejoiced to find the
gale had blown itself out.
</p>

<p>
When I sat down, he looked across the table at me,
as if expecting me to speak, but as I held my peace,
the good old man opened the conference himself.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Benjie, my boy, I have been laughing over
our fright, yesterday; but have done with your jokes,
Master, if you please, and no more about that
infernal coast of"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr Pigwell has just called, sir," quoth old
Peregrine, entering at this moment&mdash;"and desires me to
say that Mrs Pigwell is brought to bed, sir, and <i>all</i>
doing well, sir, notwithstanding the fright."
</p>

<p>
"Glad of it, Peregrine&mdash;my compliments&mdash;wish
him joy&mdash;but <i>all</i>, what do you mean by <i>all</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"She has got twins, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce! twins!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, <i>three</i> on 'em, sir."
</p>

<p>
"An Irish pair," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Two girls and a boy."
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," I continued&mdash;"why, I only fired <i>two</i> guns!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pilgarlic goes for the rocket," cried my uncle,
laughing&mdash;"but <i>there</i> spoke your mother, you
Patlander, you&mdash;<i>there</i> shone out Kilkenny, Benjie.  Oh
dear, oh dear&mdash;two girls and a boy&mdash;old Pigwell's
young wife brought to bed of&mdash;two carronades and a
rocket&mdash;ha, ha, ha."
</p>

<p>
We walked down to the counting-house together as
lovingly as ever, but my star was now in the ascendant,
for there we found Captain Jennings, who informed
my uncle that he had been obliged that morning to
land Mr Williamson, the clerk, who was about proceeding
in charge of the expedition, in consequence of
his having been taken alarmingly ill.
</p>

<p>
This was most unfortunate, as the wind appeared
on the eve of coming fair.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have a breeze before next flood, that
will take us right round the Head&mdash;I hope you won't
detain us in the river, sir?" quoth Jennings.
</p>

<p>
My uncle was puzzled what to do, as it so happened
that none of the other youngsters at the moment in
the employ had ever been away in such a capacity
before; so I availed myself of the opportunity to
push my request home, and it was finally fixed
that forenoon that I should take Mr Williamson's
place.
</p>

<p>
A very old friend of my deceased father's, Sir Oliver
Oakplank, was at this time the senior officer on the
African coast, and as the time was approaching when,
according to the usual routine of that service, he
would be departing on the round voyage for Jamaica
and Havanna, before proceeding to England to refit,
it was determined, if I could arrange the lading of our
ships in time, that I should take a passage with him,
for the twofold object of seeing an uncle, by my
mother's side, who was settled in Jamaica, and from
whom I had expectations; and making certain
speculations in colonial produce at Havanna.
</p>

<p>
As I had the credit of being a sharpish sort of a
shaver, and by no means indiscreet, although fond of
fun, I had much greater license allowed me in my
written instructions than my uncle was in the habit
of conceding to any of my fellow quill-drivers, who
had been previously despatched on similar missions.
I had in fact a roving commission as to my
operations generally.  The very evening on which I got
leave to go, the ship rounded the Rock Perch, and
nothing particular occurred until we arrived at the
scene of our trading.  I very soon found that neither
the dangers nor difficulties of the expedition had
been exaggerated; on the contrary, the reality of
both very far exceeded what I had made up my mind
to expect.  First of all, I lost more than a half of
both crews in the course of two months, and the
master of one of the ships amongst them; secondly,
I was plundered and ill-used by a villanous Spanish
slaving polacre, who attacked us without rhyme or
reason while lying quietly at anchor pursuing our
trade in the Bonny river.  Not dreaming of any
danger of this kind, except from the natives, we
allowed the Dons to come on board before we offered
any resistance, and then it was too late to do so
effectually; however, at the eleventh hour, we did show
some fight, whereby I got my left cheek pierced with
a boarding pike or boat-hook, which I repaid by a
slashing blow with a cutlass, that considerably
damaged the outward man of the Don who had wounded
me.  I verily believe we should have all been put to
death in consequence, had it not been for the Spanish
captain himself, who, reminding the villains that it
was not fighting but <i>plunder</i> they had come for, made
them knock off from cracking our crowns, and betake
themselves to searching for dollars, and boxing us
all up in the round house until they had loaded
themselves with every thing they chose to take
away.  However, notwithstanding this mishap, I
finally brought my part of the operation to a
successful issue, by completing the loading of the ships,
and seeing them fairly off for England within the
time originally contemplated.  I then joined the
commodore at Cape Coast, where I met with a most
cordial reception from him, and also from my cousin,
Dick Lanyard, one of his lieutenants.
</p>

<p>
Through the kind offices of this youngster, I soon
became as good as one of the Gazelles; indeed,
notwithstanding I was the commodore's guest, I was
more in the gun-room than any where else; and although
not quite <i>selon les regles</i>, I contrived, during
the time the frigate remained on the coast after I
joined her, to get away now and then in the boats,
my two months' experience in the rivers having
rendered me an accomplished pilot; and being in no way
afraid of the climate, I thus contrived to make one in
any spree where there was likely to be fun going,
even more frequently than my turn of duty would
have entitled me to, had I been really an officer of
the ship.
</p>

<p>
Unless there be something uncongenial or positively
repulsive about one, a person in my situation,
with a jovial hearty turn, and a little money in his
pockets to add a streak of comfort to a mess now and
then, becomes to a certainty a mighty favourite with
all the warrant and petty officers, boatswain's mates,
old quartermasters, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>; and I flatter
myself that had I gone overboard, or been killed in
any of the skirmishes that, with the recklessness of
boyhood, I had shoved my nose into, there would
have been as general a moan made for me along the
'tween decks, as for the untimely demise of poor Dicky
Phantom, the monkey.
</p>

<p>
My friend, the aforesaid Dick, had been for six
months fourth lieutenant of H.M.S. Gazelle, on board
of which, as already mentioned, Sir Oliver Oakplank
had his broad pennant[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>] hoisted, as the
commander-in-chief on the African station.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn1text">1</a>] A broad red swallow-tailed flag, carried at the main-royal
masthead, indicative of the rank of commodore.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The last time they had touched at Cape Coast they
took in a Spanish felucca, that had been previously
cut out of the Bonny river, with part of her cargo of
slaves on board.
</p>

<p>
She had cost them a hard tussle, and several of the
people had fallen by the sword in the attack, but more
afterwards from dysentery and marsh fever, the seeds
of which had doubtless been sown in the pestilential
estuary at the time of the attack; although there is
no disputing that they were much more virulently
developed afterwards than they would otherwise have
been, by a week's exposure in open boats to the
deleterious changes of the atmosphere.  The excellent
commodore, therefore, the father of his crew, seeing
the undeniable necessity of lessening the exposure of
the men in such a villanous climate, instantly wrote
home to the Admiralty, requesting that half-a-dozen
small vessels might be sent to him, of an easy draught
of water, so that they might take charge of the boats,
and afford a comfortable shelter to their crews; at the
same time that they should be able to get over the
bars, without damage, of the various African rivers,
where the contraband Guineamen were in the habit of
lurking.  To evince that he practised what he preached,
he instantly fitted out the captured felucca on his
own responsibility, manned her with five-and-twenty
men, and gave the command of her to the third lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
She had been despatched about a fortnight before
in the direction of Fernando Po, and we had stood in
on the morning of the day on which my narrative
commences, to make cape Formosa, which was the
rendezvous fixed on between us.  About three o'clock,
P.M., when we were within ten miles of the cape,
without any appearance of the tender, we fell in
with a Liverpool trader, bound to the Brass river to
load palm oil and sandalwood.  She reported that
the night before they had come across a Spaniard, who
fired into them, when they sheered-to with an intent
to speak him.  The master said that, when first seen,
the strange sail was standing right in for the river
ahead of us; and, from the noises he heard, he was
sure he had negroes on board.  It was therefore
conjectured that she was one of the vessels who had taken
in part of her cargo of slaves at the Bonny river, and
was now bound for the Nun or Brass river to
complete it.  They were, if any thing, more confirmed in
this, by the circumstance of his keeping away and
standing to the south-west the moment he found
they were hauling in for the land, as if anxious to
mislead them, by inducing a belief that he was off for
the West Indies or Brazil.  This was the essence of
the information received from the Liverpool-man;
but from the description of the Don, taking also into
account the <i>whereabouts</i> he was fallen in with, I had
no doubt in my own mind of his being the very
identical villain who had plundered me.  The same
afternoon we fell in with an American, who rejoiced our
hearts by saying that he had been chased by a
vessel in the forenoon answering the description of the
felucca.  Immediately after we hove about, and
stood out to sea again, making sail in the direction
indicated.  In consequence of our overhauling this
vessel, the commodore had put off his dinner for an
hour; and when all the ropes had been coiled down,
and every thing made snug after tacking, he resumed
his walk on the weatherside of the quarterdeck, in
company with Mr David Sprawl, the first lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
The commodore was a red-faced little man, with a
very irritable cast of countenance, which, however,
was by no means a true index to his warm heart, for
I verily believe that no commander was ever more
beloved by officers and men than he was.  He had
seen a great deal of service, and had been several times
wounded; once, in particular, very badly by a grapeshot,
that had shattered his left thigh, and considerably
shortened it, thereby giving him a kick in his gallop,
as he himself used to phrase it, until the day of his
death.  He was a wag in his way, and the officer now
perambulating the deck alongside of him was an
unfailing source of mirth; although the commodore
never passed the limits of strict naval etiquette, or
the bounds of perfect good breeding in his fun.
The gallant old fellow was dressed in faded
nankeen trowsers&mdash;discoloured cotton stockings&mdash;shoes,
with corn-holes cut in the toes&mdash;an ill-washed
and <i>rumpled</i> white Marseilles waistcoat&mdash;an old
blue uniform coat, worn absolutely threadbare, and
white and soapy at the seams and elbows; each
shoulder being garnished with a faded gold lace strap,
to confine the epaulets when mounted, and that was
only on a Sunday.  His silk neckcloth had been
most probably black <i>once</i>, but now it was a dingy
brown; and he wore a most shocking bad hat&mdash;an old
white beaver, with very broad brims, the snout of it
fastened back to the crown with a lanyard of
common spunyarn; buttoned up, as it were, like the
<i>chapeaux</i> in Charles the Second's time, to prevent it
flapping down over his eyes.  He walked backwards and
forwards very quickly, taking two steps for Sprawl's
one, and whenever he turned he gave a loud stamp,
and swung briskly about on the good leg as if it had
been a pivot, giving a most curious indescribable
flourish in the air with the wounded limb in the
round-coming, like the last quiver of Noblet's leg in an
expiring pirouette.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Sprawl, the officer with whom he was
walking and keeping up an animated conversation,
was also in no small degree remarkable in his
externals, but in a totally different line.  He was a tall
man, at the very least six feet high, and stout in
proportion; very square-shouldered; but, large as he
was, his coat seemed to have been made to fit even a
stouter person, for the shoulder-straps (I think that is
the name) projected considerably beyond his shoulders,
like the projecting eaves of a Swiss cottage, thus
giving the upper part of his figure a sharp ungainly
appearance.  Below these wide-spreading upperworks
he tapered away to nothing at the loins, and over the
hips he was not the girth of a growing lad.  His thighs
were very short, but his legs, from the knee down,
were the longest I ever saw in man, reversing all one's
notions of proportion or symmetry, for they gradually
swelled out from the knee, until they ended in the
ankle, which emulated, if it did not altogether surpass,
the calf in diameter.  When you looked at him in a
front view, his lower spars, from the knee down, were
a facsimile of the letter V reversed; that is, with the
apex uppermost, while the long splay feet formed the
strokes across at the bottom, into which the shanks or
shin-bones were morticed amidships as nearly as may
be, so that the heel projected aft very nearly as far as
the toe did forward, as if he had been built after the
model of an Indian proa, to sail backwards or forwards
as might be required, without either tacking or
wearing.  These formidable looking props were conspicuously
stuck out before him, where they kept cruising
about, of their own accord apparently, as if they were
running away with the man; while, as he walked, he
vehemently swung his arms backwards and forwards,
as if they had been paddles necessary to propel him
ahead, carrying on leisurely when he first turned, but
gradually increasing his pace as he proceeded, until
he sculled along at a terrible rate.  His head was
very large, and thatched with a great fell of coarse red
hair, hanging down in greasy masses on each side of his
pale freckled visage, until it blended into two immense,
whiskers, which he cultivated under his chin with
such care, that he appeared to be peeping through a
fur collar, like a Madagascar ourang-outang.  His eyes
were large, prominent, and of a faded blue, like those
of a dead fish; his general loveliness being diversified
by a very noticeable squint.  He had absolutely no
eyebrows, but a curious nondescript sort of tumble-out
forehead, as like an ill-washed winter-turnip in its
phrenological developement as one could well imagine;
and as for his nose, it had the regular twist of a
rifleman's powder-horn.  But his lovely mouth, who shall
describe it?  Disdaining to claim acquaintance with the
aforesaid beak, it had chosen its site under the left
eye, so that a line&mdash;I here address myself to
mathematical readers&mdash;drawn from the innermost corner of
the right eye, and intersecting the tip of the snout,
would have touched the starboard corner of the
aforesaid hole in his face&mdash;it could be dignified with no
other name; for, in sober reality, it more resembled a
gash in a pumpkin, made by a clumsy bill-hook, than
any thing else.
</p>

<p>
Lips he had none; and the first impression on one's
mind when you saw him naturally led one to exclaim,
Bless me&mdash;what an oddity!  The man has no mouth&mdash;until
he did make play with his potato-trap, and
then to be sure it was like a gap suddenly split open
in a piece of mottled freestone.  It was altogether so
much out of its latitude, that when he spoke it
seemed <i>aside</i>, as the players say; and when he drank his
wine, he looked for all the world as if he had been
pouring it into his ear.
</p>

<p>
So now, if the admiring reader will take the trouble
to dress this Beauty, I will furnish the apparel.
Imprimis, he wore a curious <i>wee</i> hat, with scarcely any
brim, the remains of the nap bleached by a burning
sun, and splashed and matted together from the
pelting of numberless showers and the washing up of
many a salt-sea spray, but carefully garnished,
nevertheless, with a double stripe of fresh gold-lace, and a
naval button on the left side.  Add to this, an
old-fashioned uniform coat, very far <i>through</i>, as we say;
long-waisted, with remarkably short skirts, but the
strap for the epaulet new and bright as the loop on
the hat.  Now, then, swathe him in a dingy white
kerseymere waistcoat, over which dangles a great horn
eye-glass, suspended by a magnificent new broad
watered black ribbon; and, finally, take the trouble to
shrowd the lower limbs of the Apollo in ancient duck
trowsers, extending about half-way down the calf of
the leg, if calf he had; leaving his pillar-like ankles
conspicuously observable; and you will have a
tolerably accurate idea of the presence and bearing of
our amiable and accomplished shipmate, Mr David
Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
Rum subject as he certainly was to look at, yet he
was a most excellent warm-hearted person at bottom;
straightforward and kind to the men; never blazoning
or amplifying their faults, but generally, on the other
hand, softening them; and often astonishing the poor
fellows by his out-of-the-way and unexpected
kindness and civility.  Indeed, he plumed himself on the
general polish of his manners, whether to equals or
inferiors, and the Gazelles repaid the compliment by
christening him, at one time, "Old Bloody Politeful,"
and "David Doublepipe" at another, from a peculiarity
that we shall presently describe.
</p>

<p>
You must know, therefore, that this remarkable
personage was possessed of a very uncommon accomplishment,
being neither more nor less than a natural
ventriloquist, for he had two distinct voices, as if
he had been a sort of living double flageolet; one a
<i>falsetto</i>, small and liquid, and clear as the note of an
octave flute; the other sonorous and rough, as the
groaning of a trombone.  In conversation, the
alternations, apparently involuntary, were so startling and
abrupt, that they sounded as if ever and anon the
keys of the high and low notes of an organ had been
alternately struck; so instantaneously were the small
notes snapped off into the lower ones, and <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;so
that a stranger would, in all probability, have
concluded, had he not known the peculiarities of the
Adonis, that a little midshipman was at one moment
squeaking up the main hatchway from the hold; and at
the next answered by a boatswain's mate on deck.
Indeed, while the commodore and his subaltern pursued
their rapid walk, backwards and forwards, on the
quarterdeck, the fine, manly, sailor-like voice of the old
man, as it intertwined with the octave flute note and
the grumbling bass of David Sprawl, like a three-strand
rope of gold thread, silver thread, and tarry spunyarn,
might have given cause to believe that the two were
accompanied in their perambulations by some
invisible familiar, who chose to take part in the
conversation, and to denote his presence through the ear,
while to the eye he was but thin air.  However,
maugre appearances and the oddity of his conformation,
friend Sprawl was physically the most powerful
man on board; and that was saying something, let
me tell you.
</p>

<p>
Thus beloved by the men, to his brother-officers
he was the most obliging and accommodating creature
that ever was invented.  Numberless were the petty
feuds which he soldered, that, but for his warm-hearted
intervention, might have eventuated in pistol-shots
and gunpowder; and the mids of the ship actually
adored him.  If leave to go on shore, or any
little immunity was desired by them, "Old Bloody
Politeful" was the channel through which their
requests ran; and if any bother was to be eschewed, or
any little fault sheltered, or any sternness on the part
of the commodore or any of the lieutenants to be
mollified,&mdash;in fine, if any propitiation of the higher
powers was required, who interceded but "Davie
Doublepipe?"  In a word, men and midshipmen would
have fought for him to the last gasp; and although
they did laugh a little at his oddities now and then,
they always came back to this,&mdash;"He is the best
seaman and the bravest man in the ship," as indeed
repeated trials had proved him to be.
</p>

<p>
The remarkable couple that I have taken so much
pains to describe to you continued to stump along
the quarterdeck, backwards and forwards, very rapidly;
and at the end of every turn, Sprawl, in place of
tacking with his face to his companion, invariably
wore with his back to him, and so lumbersome and
slowly, that the commodore usually had wheeled, and
stood facing him, ready to set forth on his promenade
long before Mr Sprawl came round; so that, while
his back was towards him, he had an opportunity of
giving his broad shoulders a quizzical reconnoitring
glance, which he instantly exchanged for the most
sedate and sober expression, when our friend at length
hove about and fronted him.  This contrast between
the fun of the commodore's expression when his
subaltern's back was towards him, and its solemnity
when he turned his face, was most laughable; more
especially, that he always met Sprawl, as he came to
the wind, with a sidling bow, before he made sail in
his usual pace; which slight inclination the lieutenant
answered with a formal inclination of his whole
strange corpus, whereby he stopped his way to such
a degree, that Sir Oliver had filled on the other tack,
and shot three or four strides ahead; whereby Sprawl
had to clap the steam on at a very high pressure, in
order to scull up alongside of his superior, before he
arrived at the other wheeling point, the break of the
quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
The postponed dinner-hour having at length
arrived, the commodore, making a formal salaam, dived
to enjoy his meal, whereof I was the only partaker
this day beside himself; and nothing particular
occurred until the following morning.
</p>

<p>
The next forenoon Dick Lanyard was the officer of
the watch, and, about nine o'clock, the commodore,
who had just come on deck, addressed him:&mdash;"Mr
Lanyard, do you see any thing of the small hooker
yet, to windward there?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I saw something like her, sir, about
half an hour ago; but a blue haze has come rolling
down, and I cannot make any thing out at present."
</p>

<p>
"She must be thereabouts somewhere, however,"
continued he, "as she was seen yesterday by the
Yankee brig,&mdash;so keep by the wind until four bells,
Mr Lanyard, and then call me, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir;" and he resumed his walk on the
weather-side of the quarterdeck.
</p>

<p>
In a couple of hours we were all on deck again;
as the breeze freshened the mist blew off, and in half
an hour the felucca was seen about three miles to
windward of us, staggering along before it, like a large
nautilus, under her solitary lateen sail;&mdash;presently
she was close aboard of us.
</p>

<p>
I was looking steadfastly at the little vessel as she
came rolling down before the wind, keeping my eye
on the man that was bending on the ensign haulyards.
First of all, he began to hoist away the ensign,
until it reached about half-way between the end of
the long, drooping, wirelike yard and the deck; he
then jerked it upwards and downwards for a minute,
as if irresolute whether to run it chokeup, or haul it
down again; at length it hung half-mast high, and
blew out steadily.
</p>

<p>
My mind suddenly misgave me, and I looked for
the pennant; it was also hoisted half-mast&mdash;"Alas! alas! poor
Donovan," I involuntarily exclaimed&mdash;but
loud enough to be overheard by the commodore,
who stood by&mdash;"another victim to this horrid coast."
</p>

<p>
"What is wrong, Mr Brail?" said Sir Oliver.
</p>

<p>
"I fear Mr Donovan is dead, sir.  The felucca's
ensign and pennant are half-mast, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Bless me, no&mdash;surely not!" said the excellent old
man;&mdash;"hand me the glass.&mdash;Too true&mdash;too true&mdash;where
is all this to end?" said he with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
The felucca was now within long pistol-shot of our
weather-quarter, standing across our stern, with the
purpose of rounding-to under our lee.  At this time
Sir Oliver was looking out close by the tafferel, with
his trumpet in his hand.  I was again peering through
the glass.  "Why, there is the strangest figure come
on deck, on board the Midge, that I ever saw&mdash;what
can it be?  Sir Oliver, will you please to look at it?"
</p>

<p>
The commodore took the glass with the greatest
good-humour, while he handed me his trumpet,&mdash;"Really,"
said he, "I cannot tell&mdash;Mr Sprawl, can
you?"  Sprawl&mdash;honest man&mdash;took his spell at the
telescope&mdash;but <i>he</i> was equally unsuccessful.  The
figure that was puzzling us was a half-naked man, in
his shirt and trowsers, with a large blue shawl bound
round his head, who had suddenly jumped on deck,
with a hammock thrown over his shoulders as if it
had been a dressing gown; the clew hanging
half-way down his back, while the upper part of the
canvass-shroud was lashed tightly round his neck, but so as
to leave his arms and legs free scope; and there he
was strutting about with the other clew trailing away
astern of him, like the train of a lady's gown, as if
he had in fact been arrayed in what was anciently
called a curricle-robe.  Over this extraordinary array
there was slung a formidable Spanish <i>trabuco</i>, or
blunderbuss, across his body; and one hand, as he
walked backwards and forwards on the small confined
deck of the felucca, held a large green silk umbrella
over his head, although the sail of itself was shade
enough at the time; while the other clutched a
speaking trumpet.
</p>

<p>
The craft, freighted with this uncouth apparition,
was very peculiar in appearance.  She had been a
Spanish gun-boat&mdash;originally a twin-sister to one that
Gazelle had, during the war, cut out from Rosas bay.
She was about sixty feet long over all, and seventeen
feet beam; her deck being as round as her bottom; in
fact she was more like a long cask than any thing
else, but with a most beautiful run notwithstanding,
and without exception the roomiest vessel of
her size that I ever saw.  She had neither bulwarks,
quarters, nor rail, nor in fact any ledge whatever
round the gunnel, so that she had no use for
scuppers.  Her stern, peaked up like a New Zealand
war-canoe, tapering away to a point, which was perforated
to receive the rudder-head, while forward she had a
sharp beak, shaped like the proa of a Roman galley;
but she was as strong as wood and iron could make
her&mdash;her bottom being a perfect bed of timbers, so
that they might have been caulked&mdash;and tight as a
bottle.  What answered to a bowsprit was a short
thumb of a stick about ten feet high, that rose at
an angle of thirty degrees; and she had only one
mast, a strong stump of a spar, about thirty feet high,
stayed well forward, in place of raking aft; high
above which rose the large lateen sail already
mentioned, with its long elastic spliced and respliced
yard tapering away up into the sky, until it seemed
no thicker than the small end of a fishing-rod when
bent by the weight of the line and bait.  It was of
immense length, and consisted of more than half
a-dozen different pieces.  Its heavy iron-shod heel was
shackelled, by a chain a fathom long, to a strong
iron-bar, or bolt, that extended athwart the forepart of the
little vessel, close to the heel of the bowsprit, and to
which it could be hooked and unhooked, as need were,
when she tacked, and it became necessary to jib the sail.
</p>

<p>
The outlandish-looking craft slowly approached,
and we were now within hail.  "I hope nothing is
amiss with Mr Donovan?" sung out the commodore.
</p>

<p>
"By the powers, but there is though!" promptly
replied the curious figure with the trumpet and
umbrella, in a strong clear voice.&mdash;A pause.
</p>

<p>
All our glasses were by this time levelled at the
vessel, and everyone more puzzled than another what
to make of it.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, sir?" again asked the commodore.
"Where is Mr Donovan?"
</p>

<p>
Here Mr Binnacle, a midshipman on board, hailed
us through his hand, but we could not hear him; on
which the man in the hammock struck him, without
any warning, across the pate with his trumpet.  The
midshipman and the rest of the crew, we could see,
now drew close together forward, and, from their
gestures, seemed to be preparing to make a rush upon
the figure who had hailed.
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver repeated his question&mdash;"Who are you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Who am I, did you say?  That's a good one,"
was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sir Oliver," said I, "I believe <i>that</i> is Mr
Donovan himself.  Poor fellow, he must have gone mad."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it&mdash;it is so, sir," whistled Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
Here the crew of the felucca, led by little Binnacle,
made a rush aft, seized the lieutenant, and having
overpowered him, launched their little shallop, in which
the midshipman, with two men, instantly shoved off;
but they had not paddled above half a-dozen yards
from the vessel's side, when the maniac, a most
powerful man, broke from those who held him, knocked
them down, right and left, like so many nine-pins, and
seizing his <i>trabuco</i>, pointed it at the skiff, while he
sung out in a voice of thunder&mdash;"Come back, Mr
Binnacle; come back, you small villain, or I will shoot
you dead."
</p>

<p>
The poor lad was cowed, and did as he was desired.
</p>

<p>
"Lower away the jolly boat," cried the commodore,
in a flaming passion; but checking himself, he
continued&mdash;"Gently, men&mdash;belay there&mdash;keep all fast
with the boat, Mr Lanyard," who had jumped aft to
execute the order&mdash;"We must humour the poor
fellow, after all, who is evidently not himself."
</p>

<p>
I could hear a marine, a half crazy creature, of the
name of Lennox, who stood by, on this whisper to his
neighbour&mdash;"Ay, Sir Oliver, better fleech with a
madman than fecht with him."
</p>

<p>
"Are you Mr Donovan, pray?" said the commodore,
mildly, but still speaking through the trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>was</i> that gentleman," was the startling answer.
</p>

<p>
"Then come on board, man; come on board," in a
wheedling tone.
</p>

<p>
"How would you have me to do that thing?" said
poor Donovan.  "Come on board, did you say?
Divil now, Sir Oliver, you are mighthy unrasonable."
</p>

<p>
His superior officer was somewhat shoved off his
balance by this most extraordinary reply from his
lieutenant, and rapped out, fiercely enough&mdash;"Come
on board this instant, sir, or by the Lord, I"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How can I do that thing, and me dead since three
bells in the middle watch last night?"  This was
grumbled as it were through his trumpet, but
presently he shouted out as loud as he could bellow&mdash;"I
can't come; and, what's more, I won't; for I died
last night, and am to be buried whenever it goes eight
bells at noon."
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" said the commodore, now <i>seriously</i> angry.
"Dead, did he say?  Why, he is drunk, gentlemen,
and not mad.  There is always <i>some</i> method in
madness; here there is none."  Till recollecting
himself&mdash;"Poor fellow, let me try him a little farther; but
really it is too absurd"&mdash;as he looked round and
observed the difficulty both officers and men had in
keeping countenance&mdash;"Let me humour him a little
longer," continued he.  "Pray, Mr Donovan, how
can you be dead, and speaking to me now?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said Donovan promptly, "I have a
forenoon's leave from purgatory to see myself decently
buried, Sir Oliver."
</p>

<p>
Here we could no longer contain ourselves, and,
notwithstanding the melancholy and humiliating
spectacle before us, a shout of laughter burst from
all hands fore and aft simultaneously, as the
commodore, exceedingly tickled, sung out&mdash;"Oh, I <i>see</i>
how it is&mdash;I see&mdash;so do come on board, Mr Donovan,
and we <i>will</i> see you properly buried."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>see</i>, Sir Oliver!" said the poor fellow; "to
be sure you do&mdash;a blind horse might persave it."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Dennis dear," quoth I, "I will be answerable
that all the honours shall be paid you."  But the
deceased Irishman was not to be had so easily, and
again refused, point-blank, to leave the Midge.
</p>

<p>
"Lower away the boat there, Mr Sprawl," said
Sir Oliver; "no use in all this; you see he won't
come.  Pipe away her crew, Mr Lanyard, do you
hear?  So, brisk now&mdash;brisk&mdash;be off.  Take the surgeon
with you, and bring that poor fellow on board instantly.
Here, Brail, go too, will ye&mdash;you are a favourite
of his, and probably he will take more kindly to you
than any one else."
</p>

<p>
We shoved off&mdash;and in a twinkling we were
alongside&mdash;"What cheer, Donovan, my darling?  How are
you, man, and how do you all do?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Benjamin, glad to see you, my boy.  I hope
you have come to read the service: I'm to be buried
at noon, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said I, "I know nothing of the kind.
I have come on board from the commodore to know
how you are; he thought you had been ill."
</p>

<p>
"Very much obliged," continued the poor fellow;
"all that sort of thing might have brought joy some
days ago&mdash;but now!"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Donovan," said I, "come on board
with me, and buried you shall be comfortably from
the frigate."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will go.  This cursed sailmaker of ours
has twice this morning refused to lash me up in the
hammock, because he chose to say I was not dead;
so go with you I will."
</p>

<p>
The instant the poor fellow addressed himself to
enter the boat, he shrank back like a rabid dog at
water.  "I cannot&mdash;I cannot.  Sailmaker, bring the
shot aft, and do lash me up in my hammock, and
heave me comfortably overboard at once."
</p>

<p>
The poor sailmaker, who was standing close to,
caught my eye, and my ear also.  "What shall I do,
sir?" said he.
</p>

<p>
I knew the man to be a steady, trustworthy
person.  "Why, humour him, Warren; humour him.
Fetch the shot, and lash him up; but sling him round
the waist by a strong three-inch rope, do you hear."
</p>

<p>
The man touched his forehead, and slunk away.
Presently he returned with the cannon-balls slung in
a canvass bag, the usual receptacle of his needles,
palms, and thread, and deliberately fastened them
round Mr Donovan's legs.  He then lashed him up
in the hammock, coaxing his arms under the swathing,
so that, while I held him in play, he regularly
sewed him up into a most substantial strait waistcoat.
It would have been laughable enough, if risibility had
been pardonable under such melancholy circumstances,
to look at the poor fellow as he now stood stiff
and upright, like a bolt of canvass on end, swaying
about, and balancing himself, as the vessel rolled about
on the heave of the sea; but by this time the
sail-maker had fastened the rope securely round his waist,
one end of which was in the clutch of three strong
fellows, with plenty of the slack coiled down and at
hand, had it proved necessary to pay out, and give
him scope.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Donovan, dear, come into the boat; do,
and let us get on board, will ye."
</p>

<p>
"Benjamin Brail&mdash;I expected kindlier thing's at
your hands, Benjie.  How <i>can</i> I go on board of the
old Gazelle, seeing it has gone seven bells" (although
it was in reality five in the afternoon), "and I'm to
be hove overboard at twelve o'clock?"
</p>

<p>
I saw there was nothing else for it, so I whispered
little Binnacle to strike eight bells.  At the first
chime, poor Donovan pricked up his ear; at the
second, he began to settle himself on deck; and
before the last struck, he was stretched out on a grating
with his eyes closed, and really as still and motionless
as if he had been actually dead.  I jumped on
board, muttered a sentence or two, from recollection,
of the funeral service, and tipping the wink, we
hove him bodily, stoop and roop, overboard, where he
sank for a couple of fathoms, when we hauled him
up again.  When he sank, he was much excited, and
flushed and feverish to look at; but when he was
now got into the boat, he was still enough, God
knows, and very blue and ghastly; his features were
sharp and pinched, and he could only utter a low
moaning noise when we had stretched him along
the bottom of the boat.  "Mercy!" said I, "surely
my experiment has not killed him?"  However, our
best plan now was to get back to the frigate as soon
as might be, so Lanyard, who had purposely kept in
the background, now gave the word to shove off, and
in a minute we were all on the Gazelle's quarterdeck;
poor Donovan having been hoisted up, lashed into an
accommodation chair.  He was instantly taken care
of, and, in our excellent surgeon's hands, I am glad
to say that he recovered, and lived to be an ornament
to the service, and a credit to all connected with him
for many a long day afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The first thing little Binnacle did was to explain to
Sir Oliver that he had been ill for three days with
brain fever, having had a stroke of the sun; but aware
of the heavy responsibility of taking forcibly the
command of a vessel from one's superior officer, he was
allowed to have it all his own way until the Gazelle
hove in sight.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr Binnacle," said the commodore, "have
you brought me the letters and the English newspapers?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Oliver; here they are, sir; and here is
a memorandum of several vessels expected on this
part of the coast that we got from the Cerberus, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me see."
</p>

<p>
After a long pause, the commodore again spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr Binnacle, I have no tidings of the
vessels you speak of; but I suppose we must stand
in for the point indicated, and take our chance of
falling in with them.  But where got you all these
men?  Did the Cerberus man you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, she did not.  Ten of the men were
landed at Cape Coast, out of the Tobin, Liverpool
trader.  They are no great things, sir, certainly;
they had been mutinous, so the merchantman who
unshipped them chose to make the run home with
five free negroes instead.  But if they be bad, there
is not much of them, for they are the smallest men I
ever saw."
</p>

<p>
The chap who spoke&mdash;little Binnacle, viz.&mdash;was not
quite a giant himself.  He was a dapper little bluejacket,
about five feet two.  His boat's, or rather his
canoe's crew, were all very little men, but still
evidently full-grown, and not boys.  Every thing about the
craft he had come from was diminutive, except her
late commander.  The midshipman was small&mdash;the
men were all pigmies.  The vessel herself could not
have carried one of the pyramids of Egypt.  The very
bandy-legged cur that yelped and scampered along
her deck was a small cock-tailed affair that a large
Newfoundland <i>canis</i> might easily have swallowed for
his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
After Binnacle had made his report to Sir Oliver,
he, with an arch smile, handed me the following letter,
open, which I have preserved to this hour for the
satisfaction of the curious.  Many a time have I since
laughed and almost cried over this production of poor
Donovan's heated brain:&mdash;

<p>
"MY DEAR BRAIL,&mdash;When you receive this, I shall
be at rest far down amongst the tangleweed and coral
branches at the bottom of the deep green sea, another
sacrifice to the insatiable demon of this evil
climate&mdash;another melancholy addition to the long list of braver
and better men who have gone before me.  Heaven
knows, and I know, and lament with much bitterness
therefor, that I am ill prepared to die, but I trust
to the mercy of the Almighty for pardon and forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
"It is now a week since I was struck by a flash of
lightning at noonday, when there was not a speck of
cloud in the blue sky, that glanced like a fiery dart
right down from the fierce sun, and not having my
red woollen nightcap on, that I purchased three years
ago from old Jabos of Belfast, the Jew who kept a
stall near the quay, it pierced through the skull just
in the centre of the bald spot, and set my brain
a-boiling and poppling ever since, making a noise for
all the world like a buzzing bee-hive.  I therefore
intend to depart this life at three bells in the middle
watch this very night, wind and weather permitting.
Alas, alas! who shall tell this to my dear old
mother, Widow Donovan, who lives at No. 1050, in
Sackville Street, Dublin, the widest thoroughfare in
Europe?&mdash;or to poor Cathleen O'Haggarty?  You
know Cathleen, Benjie; but you must never know that
she has a glass eye&mdash;Ah, yes, poor thing, she had
only one eye, but that <i>was</i> a beauty; the other was a
quaker;[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] but then she had five thousand good
sterling pounds, all in old Peter Macshane's bank at
the back of the Exchange; and so her one eye was a
blessing to me; for where is the girl with two eyes,
and five thousand pounds, all lodged in Peter
Macshane's bank at the back of the Exchange, who would
have looked at Dennis Donovan, a friendless,
penniless lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and son of Widow
Donovan, who lives at 1050, Sackville Street,
Dublin, the widest thoroughfare in Europe?&mdash;Ah, how
Cathleen will pipe her real eye&mdash;I wonder if she will
weep with the false one&mdash;I am sure my story might
bring tears from a stone, far more a piece of glass&mdash;Oh,
when she hears I am gone, she will be after
breaking her tender little heart&mdash;Oh, murder for the
notion of it&mdash;that's the thought that I can't bear&mdash;that
is the blow that kills Ned!  The last words of
Dennis Donovan, who has nothing on earth to brag
of beside a mighty pretty person and a brave soul&mdash;that's
a good one.  Adieu, adieu.  God bless the King
and the Royal Family entirely.

<p>
To return.
</p>

<p>
"And pray," said the commodore, "what captures
may you have made in this redoubtable man-of-war
of yours&mdash;in his Britannic Majesty's felucca,
Midge?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, none, sir," said wee Middy, blushing;
"but I hope you will soon put us in the way of
having a brush, sir."
</p>

<p>
"We shall see, we shall see," said the good-hearted
old sailor; "but come and take a glass of wine,
Mr Binnacle, and after you have told Mr Lanyard
all about the Midge, what she <i>has</i>, and <i>wants</i>, &amp;c.,
get on board again, and keep near us for the evening.&mdash;I
say, Mr Steelpen," to his clerk, who was lounging
about, "Come to the cabin, now, will you, and draw
out Mr Lanyard's instructions, as Mr Garboard is
still confined to his cot."
</p>

<p>
This was the second lieutenant, who had been ill
for a week with fever.
</p>

<p>
The moment I knew Lanyard was going in the
Midge, I determined to accompany him if possible,
so I asked the commodore's leave&mdash;hinting, that
my knowledge of the rivers might be of use.  He
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Pilot, indeed&mdash;mind you don't evaporate in one
of your pilotings, and then what shall I say to your
friends, Master Benjamin?"
</p>

<p>
I pressed my suit.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my good boy, you had better not&mdash;take
my word for it, if you carry on in this way, you will
either get your head broken, or be caught by one of
these infernal marsh fevers, which will be worse."
</p>

<p>
"No fear, Sir Oliver, I am a seasoned cask&mdash;do
give me leave&mdash;I shall be back in a week."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, as you please, my young master."
</p>

<p>
And it was at once so fixed.
</p>

<p>
Lanyard heard the order given, and instantly set
about getting his kit arranged for his departure,
although he seemed to think it would have been
more pleasing in his excellent captain had he
appeared to have consulted him a little on the subject;
but to hear was to obey, and Dick was quite ready to
move by the time he was sent for to receive his
orders, when I adjourned to the cabin also, to say
good by.  Sir Oliver was sitting at his wine; and so
soon as the steward had left us to ourselves, the
knight rang the bell, the cord of which, ending in a
handsome brass handle, hung within a foot of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Potter, send the first lieutenant here."
</p>

<p>
Sprawl was in immediate attendance.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to see you, Mr Sprawl; sit down, and take wine."
</p>

<p>
After a pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do you think, if the breeze holds, that we shall
make the land again before morning, Mr Sprawl?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, for we have run thirty miles off since
morning, and there is no appearance of any wind at
present; but we should be able, notwithstanding, to
beat up to it by noon to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Pray, Mr Lanyard, how many men,
counting the strangers, are there on board?"
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-three, sir, all told."
</p>

<p>
"And the gun she carries?"
</p>

<p>
"A long twelve, sir, with a six-inch howitzer
affair fitted forward, for throwing grape."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you could stow ten men more,
comfortably?"
</p>

<p>
Dick had been on board of his new command
before he came down, and had made such passing
observations as the time permitted.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I daresay, for a few days we might, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then send your purser, or whoever may be acting
for him, aboard this evening."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant made his bow, whipped off his
glass, and went on deck to be off.  It was getting
dark fast&mdash;the wind had risen suddenly&mdash;the frigate
had been carrying top-gallant sails up to the time I
had gone below, but they were now handed, and the
watch were in the act of taking a reef in the top-sails.
</p>

<p>
"Whereabouts is the felucca?" said I to the officer
of the watch, the old gunner, who, in the absence of
Mr Garboard, the second lieutenant, who, as already
stated, was sick and in his cot, had charge of the deck.
</p>

<p>
"Close to, sir," was the reply; but presently he
continued, looking over the side, "Deuce take me,
sir, if I can see her just at this present"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You don't?  I say, quartermaster, do you see
the small craft down to leeward there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  I sees nothing of her; but she can't be
far away, sir, as she was close to, within this last half
hour."
</p>

<p>
By this time the night had fallen with a heavy dew
and a thick haze.  Presently we saw a small spark
down to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the man again, "there she is; she is in
chase of something, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What can they mean?" said Lanyard.  "They
know they cannot follow out their chase when I am
on board here."
</p>

<p>
The riddle was soon read.  Little Binnacle had
returned on board, and, as it turned out, he was
determined to have some fun, in the interregnum between
the unshipping of poor Donovan and Lanyard's
appointment.
</p>

<p>
"What is that abeam of us?" said Mr Sprawl,
who had now come on deck.&mdash;"Hand me up the
night-glass, Jeremy."
</p>

<p>
He worked away with it for some time.  At length
Lanyard spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sprawl, will you have the kindness to fire
a gun, and show a light at the mizen peak, as the
felucca <i>must</i> be hereabouts?"
</p>

<p>
"True enough, Lanyard, she cannot be far off,
but"&mdash;&mdash;Here we saw another flash, and this time
we heard the report of the cannon&mdash;"There,"
continued the first lieutenant,&mdash;"there she is, sure
enough; but how the devil can you expect her to
come up to us, seeing she is cut off by that large
craft there?"  And he pointed a-beam of us,
where, following the direction indicated, I soon saw
a large vessel, standing under easy sail, on the same
tack.
</p>

<p>
"Quartermaster," exclaimed Sprawl, "keep her
away, and edge down towards that chap, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
The commodore was now on deck.
</p>

<p>
"I was on the point of reporting to you, sir, that
the felucca was a good way off to leeward, apparently
cut off by a strange sail, that is sculling along right
between us," said David Doublepipe.
</p>

<p>
"Whereabouts," said the captain, "whereabouts is
this strange sail?  And why the deuce did the felucca
not fire a gun?"
</p>

<p>
"She did, sir," answered the lieutenant, "but I
could not divine what she would be at, as she did not
make the night-signal."
</p>

<p>
"True enough," said Lanyard.&mdash;"I daresay all
the signals and instructions, and every thing else, are
locked up on board, sir.  May I therefore request
the favour of your standing down to her, or I don't
see how we shall manage at all?"
</p>

<p>
The weather now cleared, and the fog rose, or blew
past.  Another flash down to leeward, in the
direction of the felucca, and presently she burned a blue
light, which cast a lurid wake on the rolling waters,
cresting the sparkling waves with a wavering line of
unearthly light.  It lit up the little vessel and her
white sail, and the whole horizon in her neighbourhood,
with a blue ghostly glare, across which, as
a bright background, we suddenly saw the tall spars,
dark sails, and opake hull of a large polacre brig
intervene, as she gradually slid along, rising and falling
majestically on the midnight sea, between us and the
tender.
</p>

<p>
"Ah ha!" said the commodore.  "Why, Master
Brail, your retreat is cut off, and all the honour and
glory will be gathered by the Midges without you,
for there the brig is bearing up&mdash;there, she has made
us out, and if the little fellows don't get out of her
way, she will run them down."
</p>

<p>
The black bank in the east now broke away, the
newly risen moon shone out bright and suddenly, and
we distinctly saw the polacre crowding all sail from
us, with the gallant little Midge to leeward of him
about half a mile, under easy sail, apparently waiting
for him, and standing directly across the bows of his
large antagonist, into which he once more fired his
long gun, and then as he came down, he luffed up,
and hove a capful of grape into him from his howitzer.
The chase up to this time had not fired a shot, but
continued to crowd all sail, the little fellow now
sticking in his skirts like a bur.
</p>

<p>
The night began to lower again; the wind fell
from a fine working breeze to nearly calm, and the
rain soon began to descend in torrents.  At length it
became stark calm, and as dark as the shrouded moon
would let it.  But every now and then we could see
a tiny flash in the south-east, that for a moment lit
up the outline of the black sail of the felucca, making
the sweeps and figures of the men that pulled them
appear as black as ebony between us and the flash
of the forwardmost gun, which, on the other hand,
glanced brightly against the stern, sparkled in the
windows, and lighted up the snow-white sails of the
brig, in pursuit of which the felucca had again
bore up; the wreaths of smoke rising and surrounding
both vessels, like a luminous cloud, or a bright
halo.  Presently the peppering of musketry
commenced from the Midge, which showed she was
overhauling the strange sail, and was immediately returned
from the chase, who now lowered his jolly-boat, and
began to fire for the first time from his stern chasers.
This was in turn brilliantly replied to by the felucca,
when all at once the dark lateen sail came down
between us and the bright flashes by the run; on which
her fire ceased, the breeze sprung up again, and all
was dark.  We stood on for ten minutes, when we
saw a light right ahead, and before we could shorten
sail, were alongside of the felucca&mdash;the little vessel,
now a confused heap of black wreck, appearing to
slide past us like an object seen from a carriage
window when travelling rapidly; although it was the
frigate that was in motion, while the Midge lay like a
log on the water.  Presently the <i>wee</i> midshipman&mdash;Master
Binnacle, who had returned on board of her,
as ordered, early in the evening&mdash;hailed.
</p>

<p>
"He is too big for us, sir; he has shot away our
main haul-yards, and hurt three of our men."
</p>

<p>
"Heave the ship to," said the commodore; "and,
Mr Lanyard, go on board with a boat's crew, take
the carpenter with you, and see what is wrong.  Keep
close by us till morning; or here,&mdash;take him in tow,
Mr Sprawl,"&mdash;to the first lieutenant,&mdash;"take him in
tow."
</p>

<p>
We went on board Dick's forlorn command, and
found the little vessel a good deal cut up, in hulls,
sails, and rigging, and three Midges wounded, but
none of them seriously.  They were sent on board
the frigate, which made all sail in chase, but next
morning, when the day broke, all that we could see
of the polacre was a small white speck of her royal,
like the wing of a sea-gull, on our leebow; presently
she vanished entirely.
</p>

<p>
The breeze continued to freshen, and we carried
on; in the afternoon we made the land, near the
mouth of the river we had been blockading, and after
having run in as close as we thought safe, we hove-to
for the night, determined to finish the adventure on
the morrow.
</p>

<p>
By day-break, we were close in with the mouth
of the estuary, but we could see nothing of the
polacre, and as the climate was none of the wholesomest,
we were making up our minds to be off again
before the night fell; when a canoe was seen coming
down the muddy flow of the river, which, even a mile
or more at sea, preserved its thick brown chocolate
colour; with a square blanket for a sail, and manned by
half a dozen naked negroes.  She approached, and a
rope was hove to her, when she sheered alongside, and
the steersman came on board.  He was a wild
uncultivated savage, and apparently did not understand a
word of English, Spanish, or French, but by signs we
enquired of him if he had seen any thing of the brig
we were pursuing?  He indicated, after his manner,
that a big canoe had run up the river with that
morning's tide, and was now at anchor above the reach in
sight.  However, his only object appeared to be to sell
his yams and fruit, with which his boat was loaded.
And after he had done so, and we had gotten all the
information we could out of him, he shoved off; and
we prepared to ascend the river in the felucca,
reinforced by ten supernumeraries from the frigate, and
accompanied by three of her boats, manned with thirty
men and fourteen marines, under the command of Mr
Sprawl, in order to overhaul our friend of the
preceding evening.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<h4>
THE ATTACK.
</h4>

<p>
We stood in, and as we approached I went aloft on
the little stump of a mast to look about me.  The
leaden-coloured sea generally becomes several shades
lighter in tropical countries as you approach the shore,
unless the latter be regularly up and down, and deep
close to.  In the present instance, however, although it
gradually shoaled, the blue water, instead of
growing lighter and greener, and brightening in its
approach to the land; became gradually of a chocolate
colour, as the turbid flow of the river feathered out
like a fan, all round the mouth of it.  But as the tide
made, the colour changed, by the turgid stream being
forced back again, and before it was high water, the
bar was indicated by a semicircle of whitish light green,
where the long swell of the sea gradually shortened,
until it ended in small tumbling waves that poppled
about and frothed as if the ebullitions had been hove up
and set in motion by some subterraneous fire.  But, as
yet, the water did not break on any part of the
crescent-shaped ledge of sand.
</p>

<p>
In the very middle of the channel there were three
narrow streaks of blue water.  We chose the centre
one; and while the frigate hove-to in the offing,
dashed over with a fine breeze, that, from the eddy
round the point to windward, was nearly a fair wind
up the river.  For a minute I thought we were in
some peril when passing the <i>boiling</i> water on the bar;
but presently we were gliding along the smooth
surface of the noble river.
</p>

<p>
On rounding the first point, right in the middle of
the stream lay our friend of the preceding night,
moored stem and stern, with boarding nettings up,
and Spanish colours flying at the mizen-peak; but we
could see no one on board.  Sprawl therefore called a
halt, and made the men lie on their oars, as some
savage pranks had lately been played by slavers in
these rivers, such as laying trains to their magazines
when they found capture inevitable, and various other
pleasant little surprises, one of which generally served
a man for a lifetime.  So being desirous of avoiding
all chance of a hoist of this kind, we dropped anchor
in the felucca, and got the boats alongside, all to the
cutter, which was sent to pull round the polacre and
reconnoitre.  On the officer returning, he said he had
seen nothing.  We therefore determined to remain
quiet for some time longer, to give any trick of the
nature glanced at, time to develope itself.  We lay for
two hours under the most intense heat I ever
remember; the sun was absolutely broiling us alive, for
there was not the least breath of air, and the surface
of the sluggish river was one polished sheet of
silver&mdash;the low swampy banks being covered with
mangrove bushes and dwarf palms, preventing any breeze
there might be from finding its way to us.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Lieutenant Sprawl, "this is really
very unentertaining.  I say, Benjie, my dear, I think
I had better pull under the stern of the polacre to
reconnoitre a bit.  I will take care that I do not go
too near."
</p>

<p>
"I see no objections to it," said I, "none in the
world; but mind your hand, my hearty&mdash;don't go too
far, as they are slippery chaps these same slaving
gentry&mdash;that <i>I</i> can tell you."
</p>

<p>
The boat shoved off&mdash;we were eating our hasty dinner
on deck at the moment&mdash;and proceeded without let or
hinderance until she arrived within pistol-shot of the
polacre, when lo! from amongst the green bushes on the
river bank, about musket-shot from them, a burst of
white smoke flew up, and several round shot hopped
along the calm surface, stirring up the water with
whizzing splashes.  The next moment the shrieks
of the cutter's crew gave notice that they had told
in a fearful manner.  We looked out a-head.  The
wreck of the boat, with eight of her crew, including
the lieutenant, holding on by it, came floating down
to us; she had been knocked to pieces by the fire
of the masked battery that had so unexpectedly
opened, but the poor devils were promptly picked
up; all to one unfortunate fellow who had been killed
and now floated past us on his back, with his chest up,
and his head down.  Old Davie Doublepipe scrambled
on board, in nowise greatly put out by his rough reception.
</p>

<p>
"Why now," said he, "a surprise of this kind is
extremely inconvenient."
</p>

<p>
"But where the deuce came the shot from?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"The devil only knows," quoth he; "every thing
seemed as quiet as could be, when all at once&mdash;crash&mdash;the
shot took us right amidships, and the next
moment we were all floundering in the water, like so
many pigs overboard."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, lucky it is no worse," rejoined
honest Dick Lanyard; "but I say, Master
Marline," to the senior midshipman of the frigate, who
commanded one of the other boats, "we can't lie
here to be murdered, so strike out for the polacre,
keeping t'other side of the river, and her hull
between you and the skulkers; then pull straight for
her, but haul off if you see any one on board; and
if any annoyance is offered from the shore this time,
I will weigh and give our concealed friends a dose of
grape."
</p>

<p>
The boat shoved off, and pulled towards the enemy
in the manner directed.  All was quiet until she
reached within ten yards of her, when a blaze of six
pieces of cannon at the fewest once more took place,
and eddies of smoke again gushed from the bushes.
The boat instantly took the hint, put about, and
returned to us.  Her stern had been nearly knocked
to pieces, and she was leaking so much, that by the
time she was alongside, she was full of water, and the
men had only time to get out, when she sank to
the gunwale.
</p>

<p>
"By the powers!" said Lanyard, driven off his
balance, cool as he was, "but there is mighty little
fun in all this.  What see you, my man?"&mdash;to one
of the people who had scrambled up the long yard to
reconnoitre from whence the shots had proceeded;
but he could give no information.  The smoke rolled
away down the dull river in white wreaths, growing
more and more gauzelike and transparent, as they
passed us, and all was quiet, and green, and noiseless
on the bank as before; while the sun continued
to shine down on us with the same sickening intensity,
heating the thick unwholesome air, until it was
almost unfit for breathing.
</p>

<p>
"Something must be done," said I&mdash;"we must
dislodge these fellows or be off, that is clear."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think," said Lanyard, addressing himself
to the discomfited first lieutenant, who was shaking
his feathers, and drying himself as well as he could,
"that there is water for us to sheer alongside where
these scoundrels are ensconced?"
</p>

<p>
"I consider there must be," said he, "but we had
better remain quiet where we are until night, if they
will let us, so that we may be off with the ebb if
need be."
</p>

<p>
The advice was good and discreet.  So Old Bloody
Politeful, Dick Lanyard, and I set to clean our
beautiful persons, and make ourselves as comfortable as
our scanty means permitted, while the men did the
same.  It was now near five P.M., and the tide began
to flow again.  As there were two good hours daylight
still, we determined to prove our friends a little
further, rather than lie inactive any longer&mdash;the same
restless feeling had spread to the men.
</p>

<p>
"The tide is on the turn now, sir," said the old
quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"Then all hands up anchor&mdash;weigh, and sweep in
close to that dwarf palm there."
</p>

<p>
The smoke had come from a spot close under its shade.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" shouted the men.
</p>

<p>
The anchor was catted&mdash;the sweeps were manned&mdash;the
guns were loaded with grape&mdash;the marines stood
to their arms, and in five minutes we were once more
at anchor, with the two boats in tow, within
half-pistol shot of the bank.  All remained still.  Not a
breath stirred the leaves of the mangrove bushes, or
the jungle of wild cane that grew close to the river
brink.  I was sure we were directly opposite the spot
from whence the shots were fired.
</p>

<p>
Whenever we were fairly settled in our position,
we let drive both guns.  The grape pattered in the
water, and rattled amongst the leaves of the trees,
but all continued still as death.  We loaded and fired
again; but as we had only one boat untouched, Mr
Sprawl determined, instead of attempting a landing,
in order to cope with enemies whom we could not
see, to weigh and sweep towards the brig again,
with the intention, if opportunity offered, of boarding
her.  But the moment we turned our stern to the
shore, and began to pull in that direction&mdash;bang&mdash;several
cannon were again fired at us, in this instance
loaded with round and grape, but fortunately missed
us this time.
</p>

<p>
"Pull, men, like fury; give way, and clap the hull
of the brig between you and our honest friends
there."  Crack&mdash;another rally from the masked battery; the
next minute, we had swept round the stern of the
polacre, and were alongside.  Lanyard laid hold of
the manrope&mdash;"Now, men, there can be no tricks
here, or they would have shown themselves before
now; so, follow me."  The rope gave in his grasp, and
a gun exploded on board.  Dick fell back on the deck
of the felucca.  "Cast off your fastenings, and sheer
off, my lads, or we may get a hoist we don't dream of."
</p>

<p>
At this instant the battery on shore began to
play in earnest; not in broadsides, but by single guns,
as fast as they could pepper; some of the shot coming
through and through both sides of the polacre.  We
immediately hauled off for the opposite bank of the
river, but took the ground on a bank, where the
current, setting strong down, jammed us hard and fast.
We were about two cables' length from the brig at this
time, and the sun was now near setting.  The firing
continued, the flashes became brighter, the smoke
began, as the sky darkened, to grow luminous, and
presently the polacre appeared to be sinking.  "She is
settling fast down forward," said I; "by St Patrick,
she is sinking, sure enough,&mdash;there&mdash;there she goes;
what a list to port she is getting!"  She slowly fell over
on her beam-ends, in the mud, with every thing under
water but about ten feet of the quarter bulwark next
us, and the masts and rigging; which the setting sun
was now gilding.  The long shadows of the palms on
the western bank now gradually crept across the
whole breadth of the unwholesome stream, chasing
the blood-red gleam of the sinking sun, first from
the water, and then from the eastern bank, where it
lingered for a moment, on the topmost branches of the
trees, from which it also speedily disappeared,
until the only objects that vouched for his being still
above the horizon, were the wand-like tops of the
polacre's tall masts, that shone like burnished brass
rods for a brief moment; and then blackened under
the fast falling darkness, which rapidly shrouded the
whole melancholy scene; while creeping churchyard-looking
vapours, as if the pestilence no longer walked
in darkness, but had become palpable to the senses of
sight, smell, and feeling, shrouded every object on the
shores from our view, like a London fog.  Myriads
of musquittoes now began to attack us in every way,
and several white cranes flitted past and around us,
like ghosts, sailing slowly on their wide-spread wings;
the chirping and croaking of numberless insects and
reptiles came off strong from the banks, borne on the
putrid exhalations that were like to poison us; the
rushing of the river, that in the daytime we could
scarcely hear, now sounded loud and hoarse, and
rippled, lip, lipping against the stem as we lay aground,
before circling away in dark frothy eddies in our wake.
</p>

<p>
We lay still for several hours without seeing any
light, or hearing any noises on shore that indicated
the vicinity of our dangerous neighbours.  Once
tempted by the apparent quietude, the boat shoved
off a stroke or two in the direction of the polacre,
with the intention of setting fire to her, if possible;
but when within pistol-shot of their object, a loud
voice from the shore sang out in a threatening
tone&mdash;"<i>Cuidado</i>"[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] when the officer wisely pulled round,
and returned to us.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] Literally&mdash;Take care&mdash;mind your eye.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We could hear the frigate in the offing through the
livelong night, firing signal guns every ten minutes,
which we durst not answer, without the certainty of
being speedily blown to pieces by our invisible
antagonists.  About ten o'clock, I went along with little
Binnacle, in one of the boats with muffled oars, and
made directly for the bank opposite where he had been
fired at; on a nearer approach, I found it to be free
of mangroves, and to consist of a black overhanging
<i>scaur</i>, that had been scarped out by the rush of the
stream, reflected across from the jutting point on the
side where the slavers had intrenched themselves.
All continued still, and here we skulked for a full
hour, when we stole out, and pulled gently towards
the wreck, the hull of which, either from a fresh in the
river, or the rising of the tide, was now entirely under
water.  But we had not advanced above fifty yards
towards our object, when the same unearthly
"<i>beware</i>" swung booming along the water; reflected in a
small echo from the opposite side, as if a water fiend
had been answered by a spirit of the air.  We got
back to the felucca, and now made up our minds to
while away the time until the day broke, in the best
way we could.  All hands being set to cooper the
damaged boat, of which we contrived to make a very
tolerable job, so that she leaked very little.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant in command, Lanyard, and I, now
went below, and immediately sent for the three
midshipmen detached on the same service.  We had some
grog and a piece of rancid mess beef, and as turning in
was out of the question, we planked it on the deck
and lockers, and by the help of boat cloaks and
blankets, were endeavouring to make ourselves as
comfortable as we could, when the sound of a cannon-shot
was once more heard.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what the deuce," said I, "we are making
no movement&mdash;what can the fellows mean?"
</p>

<p>
There was no saying; they might, from the success
they had met with in neutralizing the attempts
of the boats to disturb them, or destroy the wreck,
have overvalued the strength of their position, for this
shot had been aimed at us; we had now plenty of
water, so we instantly weighed, and dropped down
the river out of range.  All now remained quiet until
the day dawned, and streaks of dull grey appeared
in the eastern horizon.  There was not a single
warm tint in the sky, although we were in a regular
vapour-bath of pestilential effluvia, and were any
thing but cold.  An hour before daylight the fog again
sank down on us even thicker than before, so that
every thing was hid from our view beyond ten paces'
distance; but as it drew nearer sunrise, this watery
canopy rose, and gradually evaporated in a dropping
mist, until the gorgeous east once more reassumed its
glowing blush, and the stars sparkled brightly as the
fast reddening firmament gave token that day was at
hand.  The sun rose&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Midge, ahoy," sang out a voice from the bow of
a boat, that had on the instant stuck its snout round
the point below us.  Before we could answer, the
yawl, full of enquiring messmates, was alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Master Sprawl&mdash;hillo, Master Brail;
Lanyard, my boy, what sort of an afternoon have you
spent?&mdash;Slept sound, eh?&mdash;But why the devil did
you keep blazing away and wasting his Majesty's
powder in minute guns in this way; what <i>were</i> you
after the whole night through?" sung out old
Pumpbolt, the master of the Gazelle.
</p>

<p>
"Come on board, my lad," said Sprawl&mdash;"come
on board, will ye, and you shall hear the whole
story."
</p>

<p>
They did so, and after a lengthier explanation than
the reader would willingly listen to, it was determined,
reinforced as we now were, that if we could make
out the whereabouts of the fort that had so annoyed
us, we should make a dash at it, even were we to
have broken heads in prospect.  As to attacking the
battery in front, where there was no standing ground,
it was utterly out of the question; so, as the tide
was now low ebb, and the slaver nearly high and dry
on the bank, although, in the hole we had dropped
into, the felucca was floating quietly out of
cannon-shot, we left her in charge of ten hands, and
crowding the other boats, three in all (the damaged boat
having been repaired, as already mentioned), dropped
down with the current along shore, our whole force
amounting to six-and-forty seamen and twenty
marines; and keeping a bright look-out for the smallest
gap in the mangroves that could afford an entrance.
At length we did arrive at such an opening; it was a
narrow creek, about thirty feet broad, overhung with
the everlasting mangrove, which formed an arch
overhead by the weaving of the thickly leaved branches
together, utterly impervious to the sun's rays.  I was
in the sternmost boat; the next to me was commanded
by the first lieutenant of the frigate, old Davie
Doublepipe; and as we sculled along in the clear
creek, for here it was translucent as a mountain lake,
whatever the water might be in the river, our boats
were touching, stem and stern.  Sprawl, whose
experience of the coast, and, still more, of expeditions
of this kind, greatly surpassed my own, immediately
asked me to shift from aft where I sat, forward to the
bow of the boat; the men continuing to pole along,
as there was no room for them to ply their oars.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Master Brail," quoth he&mdash;as soon as we could
communicate without being overheard&mdash;"supposing
we do carry his position&mdash;<i>cui bono</i>, what advantageth
it us?  The slaves, which, when the Midge first saw
the polacre, and chased him, were on board, are
without question once more back into cover, and must all
have been landed; so if we could even weigh the
hooker, and carry her to Cape Coast, I very much
fear we should be unable to condemn her."
</p>

<p>
"But the honour and glory?" quoth old Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Both be&mdash;ahem," quoth he; "but if you think
it an object to have a brush, why, come along, my
hearties, it is all the day's work."
</p>

<p>
I was a younger man by ten years than our friend,
and, boylike, gloried in the opportunity; so we again
began to scull along the creek, sheltered by the same
umbrageous screen of mangroves, now so luxuriant
that it shut out both sun and light as if it had been
a continuous artificial arbour.  I cannot describe the
beauty and coolness of this shade&mdash;water clear and
pellucid as crystal under foot; a long distinct view through
forests of naked mangrove stems on each side, while
aloft there was a perfect web of verdure resting on the
trelliswork formed by the interlacing of their bows,
which spread out in a delicious covering over the
whole creek.  We dislodged innumerable birds of
every variety, from the tall floating ghostlike crane
to the chattering paroquet; and more than one owl
flitted away from us, and flew up through the branches,
until the sun struck him, when, with a <i>flaff</i> and a
rustling <i>brush</i> through the topmost leaves, he came
down overhead like a shot; until, restored by the
green twilight, he would recover himself, and once
more sail away along the narrow creek, and disappear
round the corner of it ahead of us.  In one
instance, a boy in the bow struck one down with a
boat-hook, so that the bird fell against Lieutenant Sprawl's
head as he sat in the stern-sheets of the boat ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Brail, my man," quoth he, "where away&mdash;what
<i>are</i> you after?"
</p>

<p>
This narrow canal was absolutely alive with fish&mdash;they
surrounded us on all sides; and although we
could discern some dark suspicious-looking figures
at the bottom, which we conjectured to be
alligators; still there was no perceptible motion amongst
them, and we continued to pull quietly until the
head-most boat took the ground for a moment, and the
others closed upon her.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" sung out old Bloody Politeful.
</p>

<p>
"Lord only knows," answered the midshipman
beside him, as a loud snorting noise, approaching to
a roar, a sound that hovered between the blowing of
a whale and the bellowing of a bull half choked in a
marsh, echoed along the green arch.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what customer can that be?" quoth your
humble servant.
</p>

<p>
"A hippopotamus," said one of the launch's
crew; and before we could hear any thing more, an
animal, with a coarse black leather skin, and a most
formidable head, about the size of a small Highland
cow (it must have been but a young one), floundered
down the creek past us, stirring up the mud as
thick as tar all round about&mdash;but we had other work
in hand, so he escaped without a shot.  We pulled
on, and presently the mangroves settled down right
across the narrow creek, twisting their snake-like
branches together into an impervious net.  Ahead,
our course was thus most effectually stopped by this
ligneous portcullis, but close to the obstacle a small
muddy path branched off to the right, and we
determined to follow it.
</p>

<p>
It appeared a good deal poached, as if from the
passing of a number of people recently along it; and
we had not proceeded above twenty yards when we
came upon a spare studding-sail boom, to which some
heavy weight had been attached, for two slings were
fastened round it, showing, by the straight and
wire-like appearance of the rope, how severe the strain had
been; the spar itself was broken in the midst, as if
the weight attached to it had been more than it could
bear.
</p>

<p>
"Aha," thought I, "we are getting near the earth
of the fox any how&mdash;the scent is high."
</p>

<p>
We carried on.  The path became more and more
cut up, but no other evidences of our being on the
proper trail occurred; and as we could not fall in with
a tree tall enough to afford us a glimpse of the lay of
the land about us, had we ascended it, we had no
alternative but to stand on.
</p>

<p>
"No chance of doing any good here," grumbled an
old quartermaster, close to where I was struggling
nearly knee-deep in mud.  "We shall catch nothing
but fever here."
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!" said a little middy, as we braced up
sharp round a right-angled corner of the pestiferous
path&mdash;"hillo, the road stops here;" and so it
certainly appeared to do about pistol-shot, or nearer,
ahead of us, where a mound of fresh cut prickly
bushes was heaped up about six feet high right across
the path.  Whether this was a casual interruption
thrown up by the natives, or an impediment cast in
our way by our concealed <i>amigos</i>, I could not tell.  A
loud barking of dogs was now heard ahead of
us&mdash;presently a halt was called, and the word was passed
along to see that the priming of the muskets was
dry and sound; and all of us instinctively drew his
cutlass a finger's breadth or so from its sheath, to see
that it would come readily to one's hand, should need
be.  The first lieutenant, who, disdaining the common
ship cutlass, had buckled on a most enormous Andrea
Ferrara with a huge rusty basket-hilt, advanced boldly
towards the enclosure, when a smooth-faced, very
handsome dark young man suddenly raised his head
above the green defence&mdash;"<i>Que quieren ustedes,
amigos mios</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"What's that to you?" rejoined Sprawl; "give us
a clear road, my darling, or maybe we shall cooper
you, after a very comical fashion."
</p>

<p>
We had scarcely uttered the words when a discharge
of grape burst from the green mound, crashing
amongst the branches, and sending them down in
a shower on our heads; while all the neighbouring trees,
like Jacob's wands, became, in the twinkling of an
eye, patched with white spots, from the rasping of
the shot.
</p>

<p>
"Forward!" shouted Davie Doublepipe&mdash;"follow
me, men!" when&mdash;rattle&mdash;a platoon of musketry was
fired at us.  The grape had missed, from a wrong
elevation of the gun; not so the small arms&mdash;one of
our party was shot dead and three wounded; but the
spring was nevertheless made.  We scrambled across
the brushwood that had been heaped on the road, and
to the top of the stockade, about six feet high, that it
masked, and presently found ourselves in the presence
of thirty determined fellows, who were working like
fiends in the endeavour to slew round seven
eighteen-pound carronades, that had been mounted on a stage
of loose planks, and pointed towards the river.
Apparently they had been unable to accomplish this
with more than one, the gun that had just been fired,
which in the recoil had slid off the platform, and was
now useless, from sinking in the semisolid black soil,
two of the others having already, in the attempt to
train them round on us, capsized and sunk right out
of sight in it.  So aid from the cannon they now had
none; but never did men show a more daring front&mdash;as
they stood their ground, exchanging blow for
blow most manfully.
</p>

<p>
The fort, or battery, was a stockaded enclosure,
about fifty yards square.  Towards the river face,
before we attempted to turn it, the guns had been
mounted on a stage of loose planks, a most unstable
foundation, from resting on running mud.  The
brushwood between them and the river grew thick
and close, and opposite the muzzle of each cannon the
leaves were scorched and blackened.  The wooden
platform extended about twelve feet in breadth
landward, but beyond it the whole inside of the fort was
soft black mud, through which, on the side farthest
from the river, protruded the stumps of the haggled
brushwood, where it had been cleared by the hatchet;
while branches were thickly strewed on the surface
nearer the guns, to afford a footing across it.  These
branches, however, had been removed for a space of
ten feet, at the spot we boarded at, where the
slimy ground appeared poached into a soft paste, so
that no footing might be afforded to an attacking force.
</p>

<p>
The desperadoes already mentioned, were all armed
with boarding pikes, or cutlasses, while several had
large brass bell-mouthed <i>trabucos</i>, or blunderbusses,
which threw five or six musket-balls at a discharge.
Most of them were naked to their trowsers, and they
all wore a blue, yellow, or red sash, drawn tight
round the waist, through which several had pistols
stuck; while their heads were covered, in general, by
a blue or red cloth cap, like a long stocking, to the
end of which was fastened a thick silk or woollen
tassel, either hanging down the back, or falling over the
side of the head.  Some wore shirts of a striped
woollen stuff, common amongst the Biscayan boatmen.
One elderly man, a large athletic Hercules of
a fellow, bareheaded, and very bald; with his trowsers
rolled up to his knees, displaying his dark brawny
legs and naked feet, dressed in one of the aforesaid
striped shirts, and wearing a broad-brimmed, narrow
conical-crowned hat, with a flaming red riband tied
round it close to the spreading brim, stood in advance
of the others, with a <i>trabuco</i> in his hand, the piece
held in a way that it might be instantly levelled at us.
</p>

<p>
These ferocious-looking rascals had most formidable
auxiliaries, in three Spanish blood-hounds, as
yet held in leather-leashes; but who were jumping
and struggling, open-mouthed, and barking, and
panting to get at us, until they were almost strangled;
their eyes straining in their heads, or rather starting
from their sockets, as they champed and dashed the
foam right and left from their coal-black muzzles.
They were indeed superb creatures, all three of a bright
bay colour, and about the height of a tall English
stag-hound; but much stronger, as if there had been
a cross of the bull-dog in their blood.  The moment
Lieutenant Sprawl stuck his very remarkable snout
over the stockade, several of us having scrambled up
abreast of him, the man already mentioned as
apparently the leader of the party hailed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Que quieren ustedes&mdash;somos Españoles&mdash;y unde
esta la guerra entre ustedes i nosotros.</i>"
</p>

<p>
He was answered by a volley from all our pieces,
and simultaneously, in the struggle to get over,
half-a-dozen of us tumbled down, right into the soft mud;
those who had the luck to fall on their feet sank to
their knees in an instant, whilst several who fell head
foremost, left a beautiful cast of their phrenological
developements in the mire.  We fought with all our
might, you may imagine, to extricate ourselves, but
two out of the group were instantly pinned in their
clay moulds, by the boarding-pikes of the slaver's
crew, and died miserably where they fell, while several
others were wounded by shot; but more of our
fellows continued to pour in after us, and there we soon
were, thirty men at the fewest, struggling and shouting,
and blazing away, using the dead bodies of our
fallen comrades as stepping-stones to advance over;
while about fifteen more, as a reserve under little
Binnacle, had perched themselves on the top of the
stockade in our rear, and kept pouring in a most
destructive fire over our heads.  The yells of the men,
and the barking and worrying of the dogs, who had
now been let loose, and who were indiscriminately
attacking whoever was next them, were appalling in the
highest degree.
</p>

<p>
The bipeds whoso manfully opposed us, it was our
duty and our glory to encounter; but the dogs were
the very devil,&mdash;altogether out of our reckoning.  It
was curious to see those who feared not the face of
man, hanging back, and looking behind them to see
if the coast was clear for a bolt, when attacked by one
of the bloodhounds.  So our antagonists, although so
largely overmatched in numbers, had, from the ferocity
of their allies, and the soundness of their footing,
the advantage over us, and made good their position
on the wooden stage, notwithstanding all our attempts
to dislodge them; and they were in the act of getting
another of the carronades, no doubt loaded with
grape, slewed round and pointed at us, when five
marines, who had scrambled through the brake, took
them in flank, and attacked them from the sea face,
with unexampled fury.  The serjeant of the party
instantly shot the leader of the Spanish crew in the
back, between the shoulders, when he made a staggering
rush, and to my utter consternation bore me
to the ground, and then fell forward right on the top
of me.  Oh for the mahogany desk jammed into the
pit of my stomach, thought I; all your accounts are
closed, Master Benjie.  Still in my dreams I often
fancy that I feel the convulsive clutches of the dying
man, and the hot blood gurgling from his mouth,
down my neck, and the choking gasp, and the death
quiver.
</p>

<p>
I was not stunned however, although I must have
been overlaid some time, for when I wriggled myself
clear of the horrible load, our fellows had already
gained the platform, led by old Davie Doublepipe,
who was laying about him with his rusty weapon
like a Paladin of old; at one moment shredding
away showers of twigs from the branches that overhung
us; at another inflicting deep and deadly gashes
on his antagonists; his sword raining blood, as he
whirled it round his head flashing like lightning;
while his loud growl, like the roaring of the surf
after a gale, alternated rapidly with his <i>tootletoo</i>, that
gushed shrill and sharp from out the infernal noise
and smoke and blaze of the tumult.  The Gazelles
and Midges had now closed hand to hand with their
antagonists, and the next minute the survivors of the
latter fairly turned tail, and fled along a narrow path,
equally muddy as the one we had entered by; where
many of them stuck up to the knees, and were there
shot down by our people, but no attempt was made
to follow them.  Several men had been terribly torn
by the bloodhounds, who, when their masters had fled,
noble brutes as they were, stood gasping and barking;
and handling at us, at the entrance of the opening.
thus covering their retreat;&mdash;spouting out in abound
or two towards us every now and then, and immediately
retiring, and yelling and barking at the top of
their pipes.  I was going to fire at one of them, when
the Scotch corporal of marines, already introduced on
the scene, took the liberty of putting in his oar.  "Beg
pardon, Mr Brail, but let abee for let abee with mad
dogs and daft folk, is an auld but a very true adage."  I
looked with an enquiring eye at the poor fellow, who
appeared worn to the bone with illness, so that I was
puzzled to understand how Sprawl had brought him
with him; but I took his hint, and presently the
canine rear-guard beat a retreat, and all was quiet for
a time.
</p>

<p>
We now spiked the cannon and capsized them
into the mud, where they instantly sank, and I had
time to look around on the scene of conflict.  There
lay two of our people stark and stiff, countersunk into
the soft soil, which was gradually settling over the
bodies in a bloody mire; while four wounded men were
struggling to extricate themselves, and endeavouring
to attain the hard footing of the platform of planks.
Three of them, with the assistance of their
mess-mates, did accomplish this, but the fourth was too
badly hurt, and too faint from the loss of blood, to
persevere, and in despair threw himself back, gasping
on the bloody quagmire.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" said I, while half a dozen dropping
shots sparkled out from beneath the thick jungle,
and at the very instant one of the boat-keepers stuck
his head over the stockade.
</p>

<p>
"The tide has left us, sir, and the mouth of the
creek has not six inches of water in it, sir.  The boats
must stick hard and fast until next flood."
</p>

<p>
Startling enough this.  What was to be done?  To
retreat, for the time, was out of the question, so we
had no chance but in a forward demonstration.
</p>

<p>
"After these miscreants, men," cried old Sprawl,
having previously ordered ten hands back to cover
the boats&mdash;"after them, and drive them from the
jungle."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!"  We shoved along the narrow path
through which the enemy had vanished, and the first
we overtook was a poor devil shot through the neck,
writhing in agony, and endeavouring to extricate
himself from the slough.  He was thrust through on
the instant, as unceremoniously as if he had been a
crushed beetle.  A little farther on we encountered
in another small by-track that took away to the left,
three others, evidently part of the gang who had
been peppering us from beneath the covert of the
bushes.  These were shot down as unceremoniously
where they stood.  I cannot forget the imploring
glances of the poor fellows as they vainly beseeched
our mercy, and the fearful sight of their stretching
themselves out, and falling crash back amongst the
branches when we fired.  Two of them seemed to fall
at once quite dead amongst the bloody leaves; but the
third, shrieking aloud, had wrestled himself a fathom
or two into the brake before he received his quietus
from a marine, who walked close up to him, and shot
him deliberately through the heart.  Still we heard the
shouts of the rest of the party who had retreated, and
were now well ahead of us, and we pushed on in
pursuit&mdash;when all at once, as if I had been struck by the
levin-brand, a flash of light blazed across my eyes, and
I came to the ground by the run.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
</h3>

<h4>
THE MIDGE IN THE HORNET'S NEST.
</h4>

<p>
When I came to myself I was sitting in the small
muddy path through which our antagonists had been
driven.  About a fathom from me, partly hid by the
mangrove bushes, lay the dead body of one of the
white crew of the polacre.  He had fallen on his back
across a stout branch, that shot out horizontally from
one of the trees at a height of about a foot from
the ground, so that, while his feet and legs rested on
the soft black alluvial soil on one side of it, his head,
with the face turned upwards, and relaxed arms, hung
down on the other.  He was dressed in the striped
shirt already mentioned, largely open at the breast,
and wide white petticoat trowsers, that reached to
the knee, made of some strong cotton stuff of the
same fabric as the India salampore, so that the
garment looked like a Greek kilt.  It was fastened at
the waist by a red silk sash, one end of which hung
down over the branch across which he lay, apparently
saturated and heavy with black blood, that gave it the
appearance of a large purple tassel.  His collapsed
loins, where he was doubled over the branch, looked
as thin and attenuated as if he had been shot in two,
and his prominent chest and lower extremities merely
connected by his clothing.  His feet and legs, as well
as his arms, were bare&mdash;his shirt-sleeves extending
only three inches below his shoulder; and it was a
fearful sight to look on the death-blue colour of the
muscles, which no longer stood out in well-defined
and high relief, but had fallen and assumed the
rounded appearance of a woman's limbs.  The crown of his
head touched the ground, resting on his long black
hair, that had been worn turned up into a knot, but
was now spread out in a rich tress, a foot beyond him.
He had ear-rings in his ears, and a broad gold crucifix
tied round his neck by a cord of spun hair&mdash;Alas for
her whose raven locks composed the strands of it!
His mouth was open, but his eyes were closed as if
he slept; and a small coal black tuft of hair on his
chin, under his nether lip, startled one, from its
conspicuousness in contrast with the deathly pallor of
his face.  He was a very handsome youth, yet the
features inverted, as his head hung down, assumed
from this circumstance an expression so unusual, yet
so soft and so touchingly melancholy, that although I
had often looked on death before, even in my own
miserable plight I could not help noticing it, and
being moved by it.  There was no wound that I could
see, but thick black gouts were slowly trickling from
the white fresh splintered end of the branch that had
been split off in the rush, across which he lay; but
this was only noticeable at the splinter-mark, the
sluggish stream being invisible, while it crept from
his body along the dark green bark of the limb of the
mangrove-tree.  A small pyramid had already been
formed on the ground, directly below the end of the
branch, by the dropping of the coagulating blood.
The whole scene was pervaded by the faint
mysterious light of the subdued sunbeams, as they
struggled through the screen of motionless leaves above;
while the dead corse slept in the deep cold shadow
below, that to the eye of one suddenly withdrawn from
the glare of the tropical noontide, appeared to approach
absolute darkness; still a soft green ray, or <i>pensil</i>,
like moonlight piercing the thick woven foliage of a
summer arbour, fell on and floated over the face and
one of the naked arms, until the still features
appeared to become radiant of themselves&mdash;as if they had
been blanched by it into the self-luminous whiteness
of fresh hewn alabaster.
</p>

<p>
It was in truth a most piteous sight, and as the
image of my aged parent rose up, in my extremity,
before my mind's eye at the moment, I held up my
feeble hands to heaven, and prayed fervently unto the
Almighty to bless her declining years; and, if that
my race were indeed run, and now in very truth my
place was to know me no more, that my sins might,
for Christ's sake, be forgiven me.  "Alas, alas!"
thought I, bowed down by intense suffering to the
very dust, "may he too not have had a mother?"
</p>

<p>
For a minute, as I slowly recovered from the stunning
effects of the shot, I sat observing all this, and
pressing the torn skin of my forehead to my temples
with one hand, whilst with the other I kept clearing
away the blood as it flowed into my eyes; but by the
time I had perfectly recovered my recollection, my
sympathy vanished, all my thoughts became absorbed,
and my energies, small as they were at the time,
excited in almost a supernatural degree by the actual
approach of a hideous, and, in my helpless condition,
probably the most appalling danger that a human
being could be threatened with.
</p>

<p>
For a second or two I had noticed that the branch
across which the dead Spaniard lay, was slightly moved
now and then, and that some object was advancing
from beneath it, out of the thicket beyond.  I was
not long left in doubt, for one of the noble
bloodhounds now dragged himself into the light, and
wriggled from amongst the mangroves to within a fathom
of me.  At first when he struggled from beneath his
master's body, he began to lick his face and hands,
and then threw his head back with a loud whine, as
if disappointed in his expectation of some
acknowledgment.  Alas! none came; and after another vain
attempt, pain seemed to drive the creature furious,
for he seized the arm next me, that he had been
licking the minute before, by the wrist, making the
dead bones crackle between his teeth in his agony.
All at once he began to yell and bark, and at
intervals turned his fierce eyes on me, then swung his
head violently back, and again howled most piteously.
</p>

<p>
All this time I could hear the loud shouting of our
people in the distance, and a scattering shot now and
then, but the work nearer home was more than
sufficient to occupy me; for the dog, after another
moment of comparative repose, suddenly raised
himself on his fore-paws; for the first time I could see
that he had been shot through the spine, near the
flank, so that his two hind-legs were utterly
powerless, and trailing on the ground.
</p>

<p>
He scrambled on a foot or two nearer&mdash;again all
was still, and he lay quiet with his nose resting on the
ground, as if he had been watching his prey; but pain
appeared suddenly to overcome him again, as, stretching
out his fore-paws straight before him, and throwing
his head back, he set up the most infernal howl
that ear ever tingled to.  "Merciful powers! can he
mean to attack me?" thought I, as the fierce creature
left the dead body, and reared himself on his
forelegs, with open mouth, and tongue hanging out,
uttering the most fearful cries, between a fierce bark and a
howl, and again attempting to drag himself towards
me.  I made a desperate effort to rise, but could not;
and in the prospect of so dreadful a death, I shouted
for aid, as loud as my feebleness would let me.  Once
more suffering seemed to overcome the creature's
ferocity, and he stopped and yelled again.
</p>

<p>
Although I was still in some degree bewildered,
and almost blinded from the blood that continued to
flow down my forehead, and the flap of skin that
covered my left eye, so as effectually to seal it, acting
as a deadlight as it were, still, for dear life, I grasped
my cutlass&mdash;alas, the blade was broken short off by
the hilt!  My left hand then mechanically clutched
my belt where my pistol hung&mdash;"Ah, it <i>is</i> there, any
how."  I instantly changed the broken blade into my
other hand, and with the coolness of despair cocked
the pistol in my right, and lay still, awaiting the
approach of my fierce antagonist, under the tremendous
persuasion that my fate was inevitable if I missed
him.  As I looked in breathless dread, he suddenly
gave a scrambling wallop towards me&mdash;"I am done
for&mdash;God have mercy on me, and receive my
soul!"  Another scramble.  I felt his hissing hot breath; and
the foam that he champed from his fangs, as he tossed
his head from side to side in a paroxysm of rage and
pain, fell like flakes of hot sulphur over my face.  "Now
is the time!"  I thrust the pistol into his mouth, and
pulled the trigger.  Almighty powers! it flashed in
the pan!  With my remaining strength I endeavoured
to thrust it down his throat, as he coughed up blood
and froth into my face; he shook his head, clutched
the weapon in his teeth, and then threw it from him,
as if in disappointment that it had not been part and
portion of his enemy; and again made a snap at my
shoulder.  I struck at him with my broken cutlass&mdash;he
seemed not to feel the blow&mdash;and throwing myself
back as far as I could, I shrieked in my extremity to
that God whom I had so often slighted and forgotten,
for mercy to my miserable soul.  Crack&mdash;a bullet
whizzed past me.  The dog gave a long, loud howl,
gradually sinking into a low murmur as his feet slid
from under him, and his head lay open-jawed on the
mud&mdash;a quivering kick of his feet&mdash;and he was
dead&mdash;as I nearly was through fear.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," quoth old Clinker, the master-at-arms,
one of those who had come up from the boats, "who
is this fighting with beasts at Ephesus, eh?"  The
moment he recognised me, the poor fellow made his
apology, although, Heaven knows, none was required.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir; I little thought it was you, Mr
Brail, who was so near being worried by that vile beast."
</p>

<p>
I breathed again.  The bullet that had so nearly
proved my quietus at the commencement of the action,
had struck me on the right temple, and, glancing, had
ran along my whole forehead, ploughing up the skin,
until it reached the left eye, where it detached a large
flap, that, as already mentioned, hung down by a tag
over my larboard daylight; fairly blinding me on that side.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Quinton, and Mornington," said Clinker,
to two of the people, who followed him, "here, lend
a hand to bring Mr Brail along, will ye?"  They
raised me on my legs, and gave me a mouthful of grog
from a canteen, and we proceeded, following the voices
of our shipmates.  Comforted by the cordial, I found
my strength return in some measure; and when I was
once satisfied that no bones were broken, that I was
in fact only and simply <i>kilt</i>, my spirits revived, and
before we overtook our allies, having bathed my wound
with rum, and bound it with my handkerchief, I was
able to walk without support, and in a certain degree
to take care of myself.
</p>

<p>
The path continued for about half a mile farther,
and in all that route we no longer heard or saw any
indications of our comrades.  "Why, there is no use
in all this," said old Clinker; "they must have taken
another direction, so we had better return, and wait
the young flood to enable us to back out of the scrape."
</p>

<p>
I considered this the wisest advice that could be
given, and right-about-face was the word, when a
scapegrace of a marine, who had straggled from the
main body, suddenly came running at the top of his
speed from the advance, and sung out,&mdash;"Lord, sir
and messmates, come here, come here!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you see?" responded Clinker.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, here is the queerest sight I ever see'd
in all my born days."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, man? body o' me, what is it?"
exclaimed the old quarter-master, as we bowled along,
following the Jolly; the fellow gave no answer, but
skipped on before us like a dancing-master.
Presently we arrived at an open space, situated at the
head of the tortuous mangrove-fringed creek that we
had landed in.  The channel of it was dry, all above
the crook, about fifty yards from us, where it bent
towards the east, and full of black slimy mud,
over-arched entirely by the snake-like roots and branches of
the mangroves; whose upper branches, as usual,
supported a thick mat of green leaves, while all below
was bare naked convolutions of green weather-stained
stems and branches.  The muddy canal seemed to end
at this spot, under the dark shade of the bushes.
Imbedded in its obscene channel, and hauled close up to
the head of the creek, lay a large Eboe canoe, about
fifty feet long; the bottom hollowed out of one single
tree, but there was a washstreak of some kind of
hardwood plank, so as to raise the gunwale about
a foot above the ledge of the original vessel.  The
two bamboo masts were unshipped, and stowed
amidships on the thwarts, and above twenty paddles were
ranged uprightly, with the blades resting on the
bottom, on each side of the masts.
</p>

<p>
There was a heavy log of unhewn wood, about
thirty feet long, laid across the head of the creek,
where it terminated; on which three grey parrots were
clawing up and down, fastened by the legs with pieces
of twine.
</p>

<p>
Immediately adjoining was an open area of about
fifty yards in diameter&mdash;the soil appearing to have
been mixed with white ashes, and then baked, or
rammed down into a hard floor.  This open space was
closed in by a thick forest of cashaw-trees on the land
side, through which several paths opened; while on
every other, except at the head of the creek, it was
surrounded by mangrove jungle.  In the centre stood
a native house, a long, low, one-story, mud building,
about forty feet in length, by fifteen wide, thatched
with the leaves of the dwarf palm.  It had one large
aperture in the roof amidships, raised a foot or two by
piled turf, from which curled up a thick blue smoke;
but there was no opening on the side we approached
it by, beyond a low door, not above three feet high;
indeed, the eaves of the house itself were scarcely four
feet from the ground.
</p>

<p>
Right in front of us, and precisely opposite the
door, ensconced in a curious nondescript chair of
wickerwork, sat, very drunk apparently, and more than
half asleep, a ponderous middle-aged negro, dressed in
a most primitive fashion; his sole article of clothing
being a common woollen blanket, with a hole cut in
the middle for his head to pass through, while the
sides were fastened together with wooden skewers,
which effectually confined his arms; so that there he
was, all blanket and head, and sound asleep, or
pretending to be so, although the sun shone down into
the cleared space with a fierceness that would have
broiled the brains of any other man, had they been
covered by a common skull.  We were all speedily
congregated round this beauty; there was no one in
attendance on him, and we had no means of judging
of his quality.
</p>

<p>
"I say, my good man," quoth Lieutenant Sprawl,
"pray, did you see any white men&mdash;Spaniards&mdash;pass
this way?"
</p>

<p>
The sleeper appeared slowly to recover his faculties;
he first stared at the interrogator, then at old
Dick Lanyard and me, and then at our people.  He
wished to seem, or really was, overcome with
surprise.  Presently&mdash;the first lieutenant having for a
moment left him, to look around and reconnoitre the
lay of the land&mdash;a little reefer, Joe Peake by name,
stole up to him, and whether or no the aforesaid mid
had taken a small pull at his canteen, I cannot tell,
but he rattled out in the ear of the torpid savage,
"I say, my sleeping beauty, if you don't tell us in a
twinkling whereabouts these Spanish raggamuffins are
stowed away, by Saint Patrick, but I will make free
to waken you with the point of this cutlass here, and
in a way by no means ceremonious at all, at all;"
and suiting the action to the word, he gave the sable
Morpheus a very sufficing progue with the point of
his weapon, about the region of the midriff, which
instantaneously extracted a yell, worthy of any Bengal
tiger that I had ever tumbled up to see.  Presently
the howling subsided into articulate sounds, but not
one of the party could make any thing ship-shape out
of the barbarous exclamations.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my darlin'," continued wee middy, "try
toder tack, dear;" and he again excited the savage's
corporeals, after a very sharp fashion, with the same
instrument, and the howl was louder than before.
</p>

<p>
"Now, may the devil fly away with me," quoth
the imp, waxing wroth, "but I will blow your brains
out, you drunken thief of the world, if you don't give
me a legitimate reply&mdash;spake, you ill-bred spalpeen,
you&mdash;&mdash;Answer me in English, you scoundrel;"
whereupon, to our very great surprise indeed, out
spoke our sable acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, where de debil is I&mdash;who you, eh?  What
you wantee here?  I hab no slave to give you.  De
Caridad, him do get every one I get.  So, good
men, go to hell all of you&mdash;do&mdash;very mosh go to hell&mdash;do."
</p>

<p>
The barbarian again fell back on his seat, either
asleep, or feigning to be so, and began to snore like a
rhinoceros.  By this time Davie Doublepipe's attention
was attracted to a noise within the house.  "Now,
Master Blueskin," said he, "have the kindness to
open the door there;" then, as if suddenly recollecting
himself, in a voice of thunder he exclaimed&mdash;"Surround
the house, men.  Shoot any one who
tries to escape."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to arouse our sluggish friend, who
immediately got up, and staggered a few paces
towards the margin of the wood, where a most
remarkable object met our eyes.  It was a fetish hut or
temple, composed of a shed about ten feet square,
raised on four bamboos.  From the eaves or thatch of
the roof, to the ground, might have measured ten
feet; and three feet below the roof there was a
platform rigged, on which sat the most unearthly and
hideous production of the hand of man that I had
ever witnessed.  It was a round, pot-bellied, wooden
figure, about three feet high, with an enormous head,
a mouth from ear to ear, and little, diminutive, spindly
legs and arms.  A human skull, with the brain
scooped out, but the red scalp, and part of the hair, and
the flesh of the face adhering to it, while the lower
jaw had been torn away, was hung round this
horrible-looking image's neck.  Immediately beneath
there was a heap of white smouldering cinders, as if
the embers of a large fire had been swept together,
with three or four white bones protruding from the
fissures in the cake of white ashes; which, from
their peculiar shape and extraordinary whiteness,
gave me some shuddering qualms as to the kind of
living creature they had belonged to.  The whole
space round the heap, under the platform on which
the Fetish stood, as well as the posts of the rude and
horrible temple itself, was sprinkled with fresh black
spots like newly dried blood&mdash;I doubted exceedingly
whether the same had ever circulated through the
hearts of bulls or goats.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my good man, bestir you, and let us into
the house," said I, by this time renovated by another
small pull at a marine's canteen.
</p>

<p>
The surly savage, who, in his attempt to escape,
had fallen headlong, and had all this while lain as
motionless as a coiled-up hedgehog, now slowly
opened his eyes, and peered at me with a sort of drunken
gravity&mdash;but he did not speak.  I took the cutlass
from the midshipman&mdash;"Now, my man, if you don't
speak, it is spitting you on this same that I will
be after;" and accordingly, to corroborate my word,
I made a most furious demonstration with the naked
weapon, when he sung out, in great terror, "Stop,
massa, me is Sergeant Quacco of de &mdash; West India, and
not a savage nigir natural to dis dam country.  Long
live Kin Shorge, massa!"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Lieutenant Sprawl, "how came you
here, my beauty?&mdash;tell us that."
</p>

<p>
"Surely," quoth blackie; "no objection in de wide
world, but"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here our people had forced the door of the long
shed, on the opposite side from where we were, and
we could hear from their shouts that they were now
in the interior of the house.  This entirely discomposed
our new friend, and seemed to sober him all on
a sudden, if, indeed, the appearance of inebriety had not
been from the first assumed for the occasion.  "Ah,
dere&mdash;all is known&mdash;all known.  Call off your people,
gentlemen&mdash;call off your people.  Oh, what is dat?"
</p>

<p>
Here several pistol-shots were fired in the house,
and the clink of steel was heard, and loud shouting,
in Spanish as well as English.
</p>

<p>
"Who are in the shed?" Lanyard called out,&mdash;"Who
are concealed there?"
</p>

<p>
"How de debil can I tell?" said the man&mdash;"How
de debil can I say?"&mdash;and he started from his chair,
where he had again bestowed himself, and made a bolt,
with intent to escape.&mdash;I tripped up his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you scoundrel," said I, as the fellow lay
sprawling on the ground&mdash;"confess who are concealed
there, or I will run you through where you lie."
</p>

<p>
"I will confess," shrieked he&mdash;"I will confess&mdash;de
crew of dat dam polacre is dere, and her cargo of
one hundred fifty slave, is dere&mdash;so sink, burn, and
destroy dem all, if dat will pleasure massa; but don't
cut my troat please, massa&mdash;don't, I beg you, cut my
troat&mdash;God bless you, massa&mdash;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;no cut my
troat, please, good massa?"
</p>

<p>
My attention was here attracted by what was going
on elsewhere.  Leaving the vagabond where he sat,
I turned a step or two towards the long barn-like
building.
</p>

<p>
The noise in the interior continued.  "Hillo,"
sung out the first lieutenant&mdash;"Hillo, men, what are
you after?  Haul off&mdash;come out, will ye&mdash;come out;"
and he began to thunder at the low door, with his
pillar-like trams, each of which might have made a
very passable battering-ram.
</p>

<p>
The uproar increased.  "Zounds!" said he, "the
fellows are mad;" and he started off round the
northernmost end of the shed, finding that all attempts to
force the door on the side next us proved futile.
Presently the topman, and two marines, who had
remained beside the negro, also bolted to "see the fun
on the other side of the house," and left me alone
with the savage.
</p>

<p>
It was now "the uproar, with variations," as old
Bloody Politeful's two voices swelled the row.  I
looked at the negro, and weak and worn-out as I was, I
began to feel rather comical.  "Can I manage him,
in case he shows fight?" thought I.  He seemed to
be taking the same measure himself; for by this time
he had gathered himself up, and advancing a stride or
two from his seat or bench, he appeared to balance
himself, and weigh his gigantic proportions against
my comparatively tiny thews and sinews.  All at
once, like a tiger about to make his spring, he drew
suddenly back, and crouched; evidently concentrating
all his energies.  Time to make a demonstration,
thought I; and thereupon drew a pistol from my belt,
and opening the pan, slapped it with my right hand,
to see that the priming was all right, and in
immediate communication with the charge in the barrel.
He looked rapidly, but keenly, all round, and then at
me.  I grasped the weapon firmly in my right hand.
He rose&mdash;upset the bench on which he sat, in a
twinkling screwed out a leg of it, and was in the very act
of making a blow at me, when the shouts and yells
in the long shed increased to an infernal degree of
vivacity, and a hot sharp crackling, and a thick
stifling smoke, that burst in white wreaths from the
corners of the building, arrested his uplifted arm.
"You infamous renegade, if you don't lay down the
leg of that stool, I will, on the credit of a Kilkenny
man, by the mother's side, send a bullet through your
breadbasket&mdash;If I don't, never fear me."
</p>

<p>
He had now made up his mind, and advancing, nothing
daunted, made a spring and a blow at my head, which,
if I had not dodged, would have sent me to answer for
many a sin unrepented of; as it was, it descended with
great force on my left shoulder, but on the instant I
shot him through the muscle of his uplifted arm, and
down he tumbled, roaring like the very devil.  I had
started up the instant I pulled the trigger.  The door
of the long building, at that very instant of time, gave
way, and out rushed five white men&mdash;evidently part
of the crew of the polacre brig&mdash;followed by our
people.  Weak as I was, I stood up to the headmost;
and this appeared to have quelled him, for he
instantly threw down his arms.  The crackling of the fire
continued; bursts of smoke spouted from the roof;
presently they were intermingled with bright sparks,
and the yells arose even louder, if possible, than
before, from the inside; when out rushed our people,
headed by the redoubtable Davie Doublepipe himself.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Brail," said he, "you seem to have your
own share of it to-day: why, what <i>has</i> come over
you?&mdash;who has wounded you?"
</p>

<p>
"That black rascal there."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" quoth Lanyard; "shall we
immolate the savage where he lies?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;attend to what is going on in the other
end of the house&mdash;for Godsake mind what may befall
there!"
</p>

<p>
With the gallant fellow it was a word and a
blow&mdash;"Here,&mdash;here&mdash;try back, my fine fellows, try back."
</p>

<p>
The yells increased.  "Merciful Providence!"
exclaimed Mr Sprawl, as he saw his people recoil
from the heat and flame, "what is to be done?  These
poor creatures will be roasted alive where they are
made fast."  Our party turned; made as if they would
have re-entered the house, but the scorching fire kept
them back.  The cries were now mixed with low
moans and suffocating coughs, and presently a string
of miserable naked savages appeared streaming out of
the door, as fast as they could run, as if flying from
instant death&mdash;men, old and young, well-grown
children of both sexes, and several elderly women&mdash;the
ancients staggering along after the more nimble as
fast as their feebler strength would admit.  They
rushed forth, all as fast as they could, never halting,
until they had landed up to the waist in the muddy
creek, and an interval of half a minute elapsed, when
several of the women made signs that there were still
some of the miserable creatures within; and, indeed,
this was but too sadly vouched for, by the shrill and
heartrending cries that continued to issue from the
burning shed, as if women and children had been
confined in some part of it, and unable to escape.  Old
Bloody Politeful was at this time standing in the
middle of the open space, with the four middies,
Pumpbolt, and about ten men grouped around him;
the rest being employed in various ways&mdash;some in
an unavailing attempt to extinguish the fire&mdash;the
others in guarding the prisoners, when all at once the
first lieutenant sung out&mdash;"Men, there are women
and children burning there&mdash;follow me."  He spoke
to British seamen&mdash;could he have said more?  And
away they rushed after their heroic leader, stumbling
over each other in their anxiety to succour the
poor helpless beings within.  A minute of most
intense suspense followed, when upwards of a dozen
women rushed out from the flaming hut, sheltering,
with their bent bodies and naked arms, their
helpless infants from the sparks, and fire, and falling
timbers; and even after they had escaped, and had
couched at our feet, the cries and groans from amongst
the burning mass too fearfully evinced that numbers
of our fellow-creatures, in all likelihood the most
helpless of the party, were still in jeopardy, nay, in
very truth, were at that instant giving up the ghost.
Our crew did all they could to get the remainder of
the poor creatures out, but many perished in the
flames.
</p>

<p>
About fifty human beings, chiefly women, were
saved, and placed, huddled together, in the centre of
the open space; presently several of the white
Spaniards, who had held on in the shed amidst flame and
smoke, that I thought more than sufficient to have
suffocated any man of woman born, started off into
the woods, and disappeared, all to the five whom
we had seized, and who were placed beside, and
secured along with the captive blacks.  Those we had
taken were surly, fierce-looking bravoes; who, when
asked any questions as to the name and character of
their vessel, only smiled savagely, as much as to
say&mdash;"<i>Our</i> vessel! where is she <i>now</i>?  You are none
the better for <i>her</i> at all events!"
</p>

<p>
"Brail, my dear," said Lieutenant Sprawl, "since
you stand pilot, what is to be done?  Had we not
better be off with our white prisoners while the play
is good?"
</p>

<p>
"If the tide will let us," said I; "but the boats as
yet are high and dry in the creek, and we have lost the
only opportunity that offered for burning the polacre;
had we confined ourselves to that object, and kept
the boats afloat, we might have accomplished it where
she lies at low water."
</p>

<p>
"Better as it is," rejoined Sprawl&mdash;"better as it
is; we found no slaves on board, and might have got
into a scrape had we set fire to her in cold blood.&mdash;No,
no! let us be off, and try and launch the boats.
Here, men, secure your prisoners; shall we carry the
black Broker&mdash;this respectable resetter of human
beings&mdash;with us, Brail&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, we had better," said I; "we may get
some information out of the vagabond; so kick him
up, Moses;"&mdash;he was at this moment lying on his
back, again shamming a trance&mdash;"up with him, pique
him with your boarding pike, my man."
</p>

<p>
The seaman I had addressed did as he was desired;
but the fellow was now either dead-drunk, or had
sufficient nerve to control any expression of pain, for
the deuced hard thumps and sharp progues he
received, produced no apparent effect.  He lay like a
log through them all; even the pain of the wound in
his arm seemed insufficient to keep him awake.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what is that&mdash;do you hear that?" said
Lanyard, in great alarm; for several dropping shots
now rattled in the direction of the boats.  All was
still for a minute, and every ear was turned to catch
the sound, during which time we distinctly heard in
the distance a loud voice hail,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come out from beneath the bushes there, you
villains, or we shall fire a volley."
</p>

<p>
Again there was a long pause&mdash;a horn was sounded&mdash;then
another&mdash;then a wild confused yell, mingled
with which the musketry again breezed up, and we
could hear, from the shouts of our people, that the
covering party at the boats had been assailed.  When
the first shot was fired, the black resetter lifted his
head, anxiously, as if to listen; but seeing my eyes
were fixed on him, he instantly dropped it again.
But the instant he heard the negro horns, the noise
of their onset, and the renewal of the firing, he
started to his legs, as active as a lynx; and before
any of us could gather our senses about us, he was
on the verge of the wood; when all at once a thought
seemed to come across him; he stopped, and hung in
the wind for a moment, as if irresolute whether to
bolt or turn back.  At this moment one of our people
let drive at him, but missed him, although the ball
nipped off a dry branch close above his head.  He
instantly ran and laid hold of one of the pillars of the
frame that supported the abominable little idol.
Another shot was fired, when down tumbled his godship
on the head of his worshipper, who caught the image
by the legs, and seeing some of our people rushing to
seize him, he let go his hold of the upright, and
whirling the figure round, holding on by its legs, he
let drive with it at the man nearest him, and dropped
him like a shot.  He then bolted out of sight, through
one of the several muddy paths that opened into the
mangrove thicket landward.
</p>

<p>
"No time to be lost, my lads," whistled old Davie;
"keep together;"&mdash;then, in his thorough bass,
"Don't throw away a shot; so now bring along
your prisoners, and let us fall back on the
boats&mdash;&mdash;that's it&mdash;march the Dons to the front&mdash;shove on,
my fine fellows&mdash;shove on."
</p>

<p>
The firing at the boats had by this time slackened,
but the cries increased, and were now rising higher
and fiercer as we approached.  We reached the fort,
the place of our former conflict.  Heavens! what
a scene presented itself!  It makes one's blood run
cold to reflect on it, even after the lapse of years.  On
the platform lay two Spaniards, and close to them
three of our crew, stark and stiff, and already stripped
naked as the day they were born, by whom Heaven
only knows; while half a dozen native dogs were
tearing and <i>riving</i> the yet scarcely cold carcasses,
and dragging the dead arms hither and thither, until
our near approach frightened them away, with a loud
unearthly scream, of no kindred to a common bark.
</p>

<p>
One fierce brute, with his forepaws planted, straight
and stiff, before him, on a dead body, was tugging
with his front teeth at the large pectoral muscle;
occasionally letting go his hold to look at us, and utter
a short angry bark, and again tearing at the bleeding
flesh, as if it had been a carcass thrown to him for
food.  Another dog had lain down, with a hold of one
of the same poor fellow's cold hands.  Every now and
then he would clap his head sideways on the ground,
so as to get the back grinders to bear on his prey;
and there the creature was, with the dead blue fingers
across his teeth, crunching and crunching, and
gasping, with his mouth full of froth and blood, and
marrow, and white splinters of the crushed bones,
the sinews and nerves of the dead limb hanging like
bloody cords and threads from&mdash;&mdash;Bah!&mdash;you have
given us a little <i>de trop</i> of this, Master Benjie.
</p>

<p>
Two wounded Spaniards were all this time struggling
in the soft mud beyond the platform; their
lower limbs, and in fact their whole bodies up to the
arm-pits, had already settled down into the loathsome
chaos.  Some of our people were soft-hearted enough
to endeavour to extricate them, but, "Get along, get
along&mdash;be off to the boats, will ye? be off to the boats,
if you wish to sleep in a sound skin," shouted by Mr
Sprawl, made all hands turn to the more engrossing
affair of self-preservation.
</p>

<p>
But as it was some time before we could all string
over the stockade, and the single plank that led to it
from the platform across the mud, I could not help
remarking one of the poor fellows who appeared to
have been badly wounded, for there was blood on
his ghastly visage.  His struggles had gradually
settled him up to the chin in the mire&mdash;he was
shrieking miserably&mdash;he sunk over the mouth&mdash;his
exertions to escape increased&mdash;the mud covered
his nose&mdash;he began to cough and splutter for
breath&mdash;while he struggled hard with his arms to keep
himself above the surface&mdash;had he been one of the
best swimmers alive&mdash;alas! he was now neither on
earth nor in water&mdash;his eyes were still visible.
Father of mercies, let me forget their expression&mdash;their
hopeless dying glare, as he gradually sunk deeper and
deeper into the quagmire.  Oh! what a horrible
grave! he disappeared, but his hands were still
visible&mdash;he clasped them together&mdash;then opened them
again&mdash;the fingers spread out, and quivered like aspen
leaves, as he held them up towards heaven in an
attitude of supplication.  There&mdash;he is gone.
</p>

<p>
By the time the last of our stragglers had dragged
their weary limbs into the enclosure, the shouting and
firing again waxed warm in the direction of the boats;
so we made all sail towards them the instant we had
scrambled over the rude stockade, leaving the other
wounded Spaniard, who lay in a harder part of the
mud, to his fate, notwithstanding the poor fellow's
heart-piercing supplication not to be left to perish in
so horrible a manner as his comrade, who had just
disappeared.  We advanced as rapidly as we could, and
presently came in sight of this new scene of action.
The boats were filled with our people who had been
left to guard them, but were still aground, although
the flood was fast making.  They had evidently made
the most desperate attempts to get them afloat, and
had been wading up to their waists in the mud.  Four
white Spaniards were blazing away at them, and at
least one hundred and fifty naked negroes were
crowding round the head of the creek, and firing from
half-a-dozen old rusty muskets, and throwing spears
made of some sort of hard wood burnt at the ends,
while several were employed cutting down the
mangroves and throwing them into the mud, so as to be
able to pass over them like a mat, and get at the boats.
One or two of the demon-like savages were <i>routing</i>
on bullocks' horns, while six or seven had already
fallen wounded, and lay bellowing and struggling on the
ground before the well-directed fire of our people.
</p>

<p>
"Advance, Mr Sprawl, for the love of heaven," the
midshipman in charge of the party in the boats sung
out&mdash;"advance, or we are lost; our ammunition is
almost out."
</p>

<p>
Our own danger made it sufficiently evident, without
this hint, that our only chance of safety was by a
desperate effort to drive our opponents back into the
wood, and there keep them at bay until the boats
floated.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, my boys," cried Lanyard, "keep your
fire&mdash;don't run short."
</p>

<p>
"Confound you, don't fire," shouted Mr Sprawl,
"or you will hit some of us," as several of the boat's
crew nearest us continued, notwithstanding, to pepper
away; then, to his own people&mdash;"Follow me, men;
if we don't drive them into the wood, as Mr Lanyard
says, till the tide makes, we are lost."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" shouted the brave fellows, "give them
a touch of the pike and cutlass, but no firing.&mdash;Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
When we charged them, the negroes and their
white leaders were in an instant driven into the
recesses of the jungle, but not before we had captured
three more of the Spaniards and seven of their black
allies.  Our object being in the mean time attained,
we called a halt, and sent back a man to the boats, with
orders to advise us the moment they were afloat.
Worn out and feeble as most of the party were, from
want of food and fatigue, many fell asleep in a moment,
leaning against trees, or slipped down on the twisted
roots of the mangroves.  Every thing had continued
quiet for about a quarter of an hour, no sound being
heard beyond an occasional shout or wild cry in the
recesses of the brushwood, when all at once the man
we had despatched to the rear, came rushing up to us
at the top of his speed.
</p>

<p>
"The boats will be afloat in ten minutes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Thank heaven, thank heaven," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"But an Eboe canoe," continued the man, suddenly
changing my joy into sadness, "with more than
fifty people on board, is now paddling up the creek."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" exclaimed Mr Sprawl, "are we never
to get clear of this infernal corner?"  And then
recollecting who he was, and where he was, and that the
lives of the whole party were dependent on his courage
and self-possession, he rose, calm and resolute, from
where he had sat himself down on the root of a bush.
</p>

<p>
"Men, we may go to the right about now and be
off to the boats&mdash;so send the wounded forward; the
officers and marines will bring up the rear.  So heave
ahead, will ye? but no rushing now&mdash;be cool, for the
credit of the ship."
</p>

<p>
The instant we retreated, the sound of the negro
horns and drums again commenced, showing that our
movements were watched; the yells rose higher than
ever, and dropping shots whistled over-head, clipping
off a leaf here and a dry branch there.  We sculled
along, the noises behind us increasing, until we once
more reached the head of the creek.  The boats were
by this time not afloat exactly, but the advance of the
tide had so <i>thinned</i> the mud, that it was clear, if we
could once get the people on board, we should have
little difficulty in sliding them into deep water.
However, the nearest could not be got within boat-hook
length of the bank, and two of the oars being laid out
to form a gangway, no sooner did the first seaman step
along them, than&mdash;crack&mdash;one gave way, and the poor
fellow plumped up to the waist in the mud.  If we
were to get disabled in our fins, certain destruction
must ensue; this was palpable to all of us; so we had
to scramble on board through the abominable stinking
slime the best way we could, without risking any more
of the ash staves.  In the mean time the uncouth
noises and firing in the rear came nearer and increased.
</p>

<p>
"So now, hand the prisoners on board, and place
them beside their comrades there," shouted Mr Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
Easier said than done.  Taking advantage of the
uproar, they had hung back, and now as the first of the
savages appeared from under the green trees, evidently
with an intention of again attacking us, they fairly
turned tail, and before we could prevent them, they
were off, and for ever beyond our ken.  The last of
our people had got on board, all to a poor boy, who
had been badly wounded, indeed ham-strung with a
knife, and as he had fainted on the brink from pain
and loss of blood, for a moment he had been forgotten.
But only for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"God help me, God help me," said I, "why, it is
poor little Graham, my own servant; shove close to,
and let me try to get him on board."  The lad spoken
of was a slight brown-haired boy, about fifteen years
of age.  The sound of my voice seemed to revive him;
he lifted his head; but the four Spanish prisoners,
whom we had secured on board, on the instant, as if
moved by one common impulse, made a bound overboard;
although they sank up to the waist, they made
a desperate attempt to reach the bank; the leading
one, who seemed to have been an officer, shouting out
to their allies in the wood, "<i>Camaradas, una golpe
bueno, y somos salvados&mdash;una golpe fuerte, y somos
libres</i>."  This was the signal for a general rush of the
combined column from the thicket; the black naked
savages, led on by the white crew of the slaver.  As
they rushed down to the brink, the poor wounded lad
made a desperate attempt to rise; and as he ran a step
or two staggering towards the creek, he looked behind
him at the negroes, who were advancing with loud
shouts.  He then, with his face as pale as ashes, and
lips blue as indigo, and eyes starting from the socket,
called out, "For the dear love of Jesus, shove ahead,
and save me; Oh!  Mr Sprawl, save me!  Mr Brail,
for God Almighty's sake, don't desert me, Oh sir!"  A
black savage had rushed forward and seized him&mdash;I
fired&mdash;he dropped, dragging the boy down with him;
and I could see him in his agony try to tear him with
his teeth, while the helpless lad struggled with all his
might to escape from the dying barbarian.  He did
get clear of him; and with a strength that I could not
believe he had possessed, he once more got on his legs,
and hailed me again; but the uproar was now so loud,
and the firing so hot, that I could not hear what he
said.
</p>

<p>
"The boats are afloat, the boats are afloat!"
shouted twenty voices at once.  At this very moment
a negro caught the lad round the waist, another laid
hold of him by the hair, and before he could free
himself, the latter drew his knife round his neck&mdash;the
next instant the trunk, with the blood gushing from
the severed arteries, was quivering amongst the mud,
while the monster held aloft the bleeding head with
its quivering and twitching features.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven have mercy on us&mdash;Heaven have mercy
on us!" said I; but we were now widening our distance
fast, although I could see them strip the body with
the speed of the most expert camp-follower; and while
the Spaniards on shore were, even under our fire,
trying to extricate their comrades, all of them wounded,
who were floundering in the slime and ooze, their
black allies were equally active in cutting up and
mutilating the poor boy with the most demoniacal
ferocity and ..... I dare not attempt further
description of a scene so replete with horror and
abomination.  We poled along, with all the little strength
that a day of such dreadful incidents, and a climate of
the most overpowering heat and fearful insalubrity,
had left us.  At length the creek widened so as to
allow us to ply our oars, when we perceived the large
Eboe war-canoe, already mentioned, in the very act of
entering the narrow canal we were descending.  As
we approached, we had an opportunity of observing
the equipment of this remarkable craft; it was
upwards of sixty feet long, and manned by forty
hands&mdash;twenty of a side, all plying their great broad-bladed
paddles.  These men sat close to the gunwale of the
vessel on each side, looking forward, and delving up
the water with their shovel-shaped paddles, the two
rows sufficiently apart to leave room for upwards of
fifty naked men and women to be stowed amidships.
These last were all bound with withes, or some kind
of country rope; and although there were no serious
or very evident demonstrations of grief amongst them,
yet it at once occurred to me, that they were slaves
sent down to our black friend's depot, to await the
arrival of the next vessel, or probably they were intended
to have completed the polacre's cargo.  An old
white-headed, yellow-skinned negro, bearing the tatooed
marks of a high-caste man of his tribe on his
square-featured visage, as if the skin had been peeled off his
temples on each side, was seated in the bow.  He
evidently took us for part of the crew of some slaver
lying below.  He shouted to us, and pointed to his
cargo; but we had other fish to fry, and accordingly
never relaxed in our pulling, until at five in the
afternoon, we were once more on board of the felucca.

CHAPTER IV.
</h3>

<h4>
THE EVENING AFTER THE BRUSH.
</h4>

<p>
On mustering, we found our loss had been
exceedingly severe&mdash;no fewer than seven missing, five
of whom, I knew, had been killed outright, and
fourteen wounded, some of them seriously enough.
The first thing we did was to weigh and drop
down out of gunshot of the fort, when we again
anchored close under the bank on the opposite side
of the river.  By the time we were all snug it was
near six o'clock in the evening; and the wild cries
and uproar on the bank had subsided, no sound
marking the vicinity of our dangerous neighbours,
excepting a startling shout now and then, that gushed
from the mangrove jungle; while a thick column
of smoke curled up into the calm evening sky
from the smoking ruins of the house.  Presently,
thin grey vapours arose from the surface of the
water on each bank, and rolled sluggishly towards us
from the right and left, until the two sheets of mist
nearly met.  Still a clear canal remained in the
middle of the noble stream, as if its dark flow had
been narrowed to a space that a pistol-shot would
have flown across point-blank.  For an hour, the
fog increased, until it became like wreaths of wool,
and then, when at the densest, it rose gradually,
until the bushes on each side of the river became
dimly visible, as if a gauze screen had been
interposed between us and them.  It continued
gradually to roll back, right and left, landward; until it
folded over and overlapped the trees on the banks,
creeping along the tops of them, yet leaving the air
clear as crystal above its influence, where presently
the evening star rose sparkling as brightly as if it
had been a frosty sunset.  But we were not long
to enjoy this pure atmosphere, for right ahead of us a
thicker body of vapour than what had come off
previously began to roll down the river, floating in the
air about ten or twelve feet from the surface of the
water, where it hung in a well-defined cloud, without
in any way melting into the clear atmosphere overhead.
When it reached within a cable's length of us, it
became stationary, and owned allegiance to the genius
of the sea-breeze, growing thin and smoke-like, and
diffusing itself, and poisoning the air all round.  It was
the most noxious I ever breathed.
</p>

<p>
"Palpable marsh miasmata; the yellow fever in
visible perfection," quoth Lieutenant Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
Through this mist, the glowing sun, now near his
setting, suddenly became shorn of his golden hair,
and obliged us with a steady view of his red bald
globe; while his splendid wake, that half an hour
before sparkled on the broad rushing of the mighty
stream, converting its whirling eddies into molten gold,
was suddenly quenched under the chill pestilential
fen-damp; and every thing looked as like the shutting
in of a winter's night in Ould Ireland as possible,
with a dash of vapour from my own river Lee, which
has mud enough to satisfy even a Cork pig, and that
is saying a good deal.  Had we only had the cold, the
similitude would have been perfect.
</p>

<p>
The sun set; and all hands, men and officers, carried
on in getting themselves put to rights as well as
they could, after a day of such excitement and
stirring incidents.  None of the wounded, I was
rejoiced to find, were likely to slip through our fingers;
but the fate of the poor fellows who were missing&mdash;What
was it?  Had they been fairly shot down, or
sabred on the spot, or immolated afterwards&mdash;after the
scenes we had witnessed, what might it not have been?
The surgeon's mate, who constituted part of our
appointment, was a skilful fellow in his way, and I had
soon the gratification to see all the men who had been
hurt properly cared for.  As for my own wound,
thanks to the profuse hæmorrhage, the sensation
was now more that of a stunning blow than any
thing else; and, with the exception of the bandage
round my head, I was not a great deal the worse,
neither to look at, nor indeed in reality.  Old Davie
Doublepipe, Dick Lanyard, and myself, had dived
into the small cabin; and having taken all the
precautions that men could do in our situation, we sat down,
along with Pumpbolt the master, the two reefers,
who had come in the frigate's boats, and little
Binnacle, to our salt junk and grog.
</p>

<p>
"A deuced comfortable expedition, Brail, my
darling, we have had this same day," <i>quod</i> Dick.
</p>

<p>
"Very," responded Benjamin Brail, Esquire.  "But,
here's to you, my man, <i>Dum vivimus vivamus</i>&mdash;so
spare me that case bottle of rum."
</p>

<p>
However, we were too awkwardly placed to spend
much time over our frugal repast, as the poets say;
so presently we were all on deck again.  How beautiful,
and how different the scene.  A small cool breath
of wind from the land had again rolled away the impure
air from the bosom of the noble river, and every thing
overhead was once more clear and transparent.  The
bright new risen moon was far advanced in the second
quarter, and cast a long trembling wake of silver light
on the water, sparkling like diamonds on the tiny
ripples, while the darkened half of the chaste planet
herself was as perfectly visible, as if her disk had
been half silver and half bronze.  Her mild light,
however, was not strong enough to quench the host
of glorious stars that studded the cloudless
firmament.  On either hand, the black banks were now
clearly defined against the sky; the one shore being
lit up by the rising moon, and the other by the last
golden tints of the recently set sun.
</p>

<p>
The smoke over the site of the conflagration,
which had been pale grey during the daylight,
became gradually luminous and bright as the night
closed in; and every now and then, as if part of
the building we had seen on fire had fallen in, a cloud
of bright sparks would fly up into the air, spangling
the rolling masses of the crimson-tinged wreaths of
smoke.  At length the light and flame both slowly
decreased, until they disappeared altogether; leaving
no indication as to their whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said I, "we may all turn in quietly for
the night.  The savages ashore there seem at length
to be asleep."
</p>

<p>
The words were scarcely out of my mouth, when a
bright glare, as if a flame from a heap of dry wood
chips had suddenly blazed up, once more illuminated
the whole sky right over where we had seen the sparks
and luminous smoke, while a loud concert of Eboe
drums, horns, and wild shouts, arose in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"Some vile Fetish rite is about being celebrated,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
The noise and glare continued, and with a sickening
feeling, I turned away and looked towards the
rising moon.  Her rays trembled on the gurgling and
circling eddies of the river, making every trunk of a
tree, or wreath of foam as it floated down with the
current, loom clear and distinct, as they swam in black
chains and dark masses past the sparkling line her
chaste light illuminated.  I had leaned for near a
quarter of an hour with folded arms, resting my back
against the lowered yard, admiring the serenity of the
scene, and contrasting it with the thrilling events of
the day, pondering in my own mind what the morrow
was to bring forth, when a large branch of a tree,
covered with foliage, floated past and attracted my
attention&mdash;the black leaves twinkling in the night
breeze between us and the shining river.  Immediately
a small canoe, with two dark figures in it, launched
out from the darkness; swam down the river into the
bright wake of the glorious planet, where the water
flowed past in a sheet of molten silver, and floated
slowly across it.  The next moment it vanished in the
darkness.  I saw it distinctly&mdash;there could be no mistake.
</p>

<p>
"I say, friend Sprawl,"&mdash;he was standing beside
me enjoying the luxury of a cigar,&mdash;"did you see
that?" pointing in the direction where the tiny craft
had disappeared.  He had also seen it.
</p>

<p>
"We had better keep a bright look-out," continued
I; "those savages may prove more venturesome in
the darkness than we chose this morning to believe
possible."
</p>

<p>
I kept my eye steadily in the direction where we
had seen the canoe vanish; but she continued invisible,
and nothing for some time occurred to create any
alarm.  Every thing remained quiet and still.  Even
the shouting on shore had entirely ceased.  On board
of the felucca, the men were clustered round a blazing
fire forward, that cast a bright red glare on the rushing
water as it whizzed past, lap-lapping against our
bows, and closing in on the rudder, making it <i>cheep</i> as
it was <i>jigged</i> from side to side, with a buzzing gurgle;
while the small round whirling eddies, visible by the
tiny circles of white froth and hissing bells, where the
divided waters spun away as if glad of their reunion
in our wake, rolled down astern of us, blending
together in one dark eddy, wherein the boats under the
tafferel sheered about, with the water flashing at their
bows, like so many captured hippopotami, until I
expected every moment to see the taught painters
torn away.
</p>

<p>
The wounded by this time were all stowed snugly
below, but the figures on the crowded deck of the
little vessel glanced wildly round the crackling fire.
Many of the men, who had floundered in the slime of
the creek, appeared like absolute statues of plaster of
Paris, when the mud had dried on them, which they
were busily employed in picking off, great patches of
the hardened filth having adhered to their clothes like
greaves and cuisses.  Some were engaged cooking their
food, others were cleaning their arms, while the grog
went round cheerily, and the loud laugh and coarse
jest evinced the buoyancy of young hearts, even while
they sat within ear-shot of the groans of their
wounded comrades, and the bodies of those who had fallen
were scarce cold; while the most appalling dangers to
themselves had just been surmounted.
</p>

<p>
Lanyard was now called below by the surgeon's
mate to inspect the condition of the wounded.  Old
Bloody Politeful and myself accompanied him.  None
of the sound part of the crew had yet turned in, but,
in the hurry of going ashore, all their hammocks had
been left slung, and, as the between decks was barely
five feet high, it was rather a bothersome matter to
navigate between the rows of them, empty and full.
Two large lanterns hung from hooks screwed into
the beams amidships, but the lights within were none
of the brightest, nor were the glass panes any of
the clearest; so they did not greatly elucidate the
state of matters; but, in another sense, if to afford
heat to the confined berth-deck had been an object,
they constituted a most efficient apparatus, from the
hot fat smoke that screwed out of the little perforated
tin domes at the top.  Immediately above the lanterns,
that were suspended by pieces of spunyarn about six
inches long, and on each side of the beam, where it
had been bevelled away, was arrayed a whole swarm
of cockroaches in two circles, with their heads inward,
and their long feelers in perpetual motion, like the
spears of the serried phalanx of old,&mdash;a more courageous
beetle than the rest, every now and then making
a forward movement of a step or two, until the heat
of the ascending flame scorched him back again.
However, we soon had to attend to other matters.
</p>

<p>
The first amongst the wounded that I had occasion
to address was the corporal of marines, of whom
mention has been before made,&mdash;one of the boats'-crews
who were leagued with us.  He was, although
reputed half crazy in the ship, a fine handsome young
fellow&mdash;a Scotchman.  When we came down he was
speaking to a messmate, who stood beside his
hammock helping him to some drink.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, man," said he, "did ye no remark the clearness
and stillness of the creek, after leaving the
muddy river, just before the action began&mdash;immediately
before it was stirred up by that hideous,
highland-cow-looking beast of a hippopotamy; the vile brute
that raised the mud, until it converted the crystal
clear water into pease brose, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to it?  I
hate these wee Highland <i>nowt</i>.  A big sonsy stot is
a manageable animal, and respectable withal, and
quiet; but thae sma' hieland deevils!&mdash;&mdash;Hech! what
sharp horns they have!  And although a bold front
aye quells them, still they always are on the look-out
to take you at disadvantage&mdash;in the louping of a dyke,
for instance, wha will assure ye that they shall not
kittle your hinderlins?&mdash;But what am I raving about?&mdash;Ou
ay! about the clear creek, with the white scales
of the bit fishes turning up their sides to the light,
and glancing like silver far down in the transparent
depths of the deep water, as we lay on our oars.  Guid
kens&mdash;forbye being weak and worn, and scant o' glee,
for a leaden weight lay on my speerits&mdash;yet the sicht
drave me aff and awa' in a moment amang my ain
native blue hills and heathery braes&mdash;ay, and clear
saugh-fringed sparkling burnies too, rippling bonnily
in the sunshine owre their half-dry channels of bright
sand and pebbles, with the trouts louping <i>plump,
plump</i>, out of the swirls at the bottom of the ripples
at the grey flies, and then glancing up the rushing
streams, zig-zag like fire-flaughts from ae shadowy
bank till another&mdash;although all the while I was
conscious that maybe, between disease, and shot, and
cauld iron, I was but a step frae heeven&mdash;we'll no
name the other place.  Oh, that thocht of my home
brack in upon my mind like a gleam of sunshine on a
stormy sea."
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, there's poetry for you, Master Lanyard,"
said I, a good deal surprised.
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow had heard me speak, and presently
appeared to become highly excited, and to breathe
very hard.  Sprawl and I had by this time stuck our
heads up between the rows of hammocks.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lennox, what may be wrong with you?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing very particular," was the answer; "only
I am afraid that I am about departing for yon place."
</p>

<p>
"What place?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Ou!  I just meant to insinuate to your honour,
that I was dying."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, nonsense!" said Sprawl; "don't be so
chicken-hearted, man.  No fear of you, if you will but
keep a good heart."
</p>

<p>
"It may be sae, it may be sae; but I am doomed,
and I know it."
</p>

<p>
"How?" said I, much interested&mdash;"How?  Tell
me what forebodings you have had&mdash;do now?"
</p>

<p>
To make what passed after this intelligible, it is
proper to remark, that this poor fellow, notwithstanding
his peculiarities, was the most sober and hard-working
man in the frigate&mdash;a favourite with all
hands, men and officers.  It appeared that, for several
days before the setting out of the expedition, he
had been suffering from dysentery,&mdash;indeed, he had
been so very ill, that this very morning the surgeon
had given him eighty drops of laudanum;&mdash;notwithstanding,
he would not on any account be left behind,
but insisted on going in the boats.  It was soon
evident, however, that even during the attack he was
unnaturally elevated by the effects of the medicine;
for although a known and tried hand, and acknowledged
to be one of the bravest men in the ship, yet his
extraordinary conduct had startled many of us, myself
amongst others.  When the long shed was set fire to,
for instance, I thought he was drunk, for he kept
swaggering about, with half shut eyes, and speaking to
himself, in a manner altogether unaccountable,
knowing as I did the character of the man; but in the
tumult I had after this lost sight of him.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you so down-hearted, my man?"
</p>

<p>
I now saw that the poor fellow was evidently still
under the influence of laudanum, although the
exhilarating effects had evaporated.  It afterwards came to
my knowledge, that the surgeon, seeing his weak state
when the boats got on board again, had given him.
another dose, but this had not yet had time to operate.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you so down-hearted?" I repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Down-hearted!" he rejoined, his eyes twinkling
brightly, as the fresh doze began to operate;
"down-hearted, bless your honour!  I was rather so,
certainly, some time ago, but now I begin to feel myself
growing the happiest fellow in the whole ship,&mdash;yes,
the happiest&mdash;happy&mdash;hap"&mdash;&mdash;and he fell over into
a short troubled snooze.
</p>

<p>
Some time elapsed, and I had removed to another
part of the vessel, when I again heard his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Stand clear until I get out&mdash;don't you hear them
call all hands?&mdash;so,"&mdash;and before I could prevent him
he had floundered on deck.
</p>

<p>
We lifted him into his hammock again.  He still
continued to breathe very hard.  At length he looked
me right in the face,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I say, master-at-arms&mdash;Lord! what a comical
dream I have had!  Why, we were all ashore cutting
out,&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a little heathen god,
defended by bull-dogs!&mdash;and a devil of a good fight
he made of it, ha, ha, ha!&mdash;We were too many for
him though; and when we had set fire to his house,
and split the skulls of a thousand of his people or so,
the little grinning, monkeyfied son-of-a-gun, just as I
was taking aim at him, jumped down from his perch,
and flew like a cannon-shot right against me, giving
me such a settler, ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Zounds! only fancy
Jack Lennox mentioned in the return, as 'Killed by
a heathen god! the bloody little image pitching itself
right into his stomach!'&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
And so in truth it was.  For when our friend
Sergeant Quacco bolted, on finding the shrine of the
Fetish no sanctuary, and had whirled the image
amongst us, the uncouth missile had brought up in
the pit of poor Lennox's stomach sure enough, where
it had told most fearfully.
</p>

<p>
All the wounded complained greatly of thirst,
scarcely one of them in his groanings saying a word
about the <i>pain</i> of his wounds.
</p>

<p>
Another poor fellow, an Irishman, who belonged
to the frigate's mizen-top, had got a cruel cut
transversely down his cheek, which it had fairly laid
open.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Callaghan," said I, in my new capacity of
surgeon's mate, "how do you get on?  Ugly gash
that&mdash;spoiled your beauty, my fine fellow.  But never
mind&mdash;Greenwich at the worst under your lee, you
know."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, with a face as pale as death, but
with a comical expression notwithstanding, and a
bright twinkle of his eye&mdash;"Please you, sir, tobacco
juice nips like fury."
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it.  But what have you to do with
it at present?  Wait until your wound gets better.
Surely you have not a quid in your cheek <i>now</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He sucked in his sound cheek; but the exertion
started the plaster-straps that had been applied across
the wound in the other, and the blood began to flow.
</p>

<p>
"Blazes!" said he, "if that d&mdash;d quid won't be the
death of me!" and thereupon he hooked it out of his
potato-trap with his finger, and threw the cherished
morsel with great violence from him.
</p>

<p>
Here our Scotch friend again broke in upon us&mdash;"I
say, you Clinker&mdash;you master-at-arms&mdash;damn me
(gude forgie me for swearing) if I think it is a dream
after all.  I am now sure it was a <i>bona fide</i> spree that
we have had on shore, and that my days are
numbered from the thump I received from the graven
image.  Lord, that Saunders Skelp should have been
left <i>to dree such weird</i>!  Hech, but <i>the contusion</i> was
most awful sair!"
</p>

<p>
I pricked up my ears when, first of all in his ravings,
I heard the poor fellow pronounce the words <i>bona
fide</i>, but followed up as this was by his speaking of a
<i>contusion</i>, a word utterly unknown amongst the crew
on the berth-deck, I became riveted to the spot, and
most anxiously desirous to know something more of
our marine.  I had stepped a few paces towards the
ladder, but my curiosity again drew me to the side
of his hammock.
</p>

<p>
"I say, friend, wha may ye be?" said the man&mdash;in
the common routine of the ship, I had never
noticed his Scotch accent before; more Scotch now, by
the way, than it usually was&mdash;"I say, friend, what
for do you persevere in haunting me in this way?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, my good man, I am only lending a hand to
see you and the rest of the wounded properly cared
for&mdash;believe me, I have no desire to bother you or
any one else."
</p>

<p>
"It may be all vera true," said he, turning himself,
apparently with great pain, on his back; "it
may be vera true&mdash;but noo, sin' I am persuaded that I
dinna dream, let me gather the sma' wits God has gi'en
me weel about me.  Let me see&mdash;let me see&mdash;we all
ken the service we were ordered on this blessed
morning&mdash;nane better than Saunders Skelp&mdash;what am I
dreaming o'?  Jack Lennox, I mean&mdash;gude hae a
care o' us, my harns[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>] are strangely confused."  Then,
after a pause, during which he appeared to be
exerting himself to call in his scattered thoughts&mdash;"Weel
a-weel, ye a' ken wha focht, and wha sang sma, and
mony a stalwart blow was struck&mdash;<i>that</i> I ken&mdash;and
sickly as I was, it behoved me, the son o' auld Pate
Skelp of Lincomdodie, to do my <i>devoir</i>, as Sir Walter
says, and to it I buckled; but I shall believe in
second sicht or any other miracle noo, for we drave a'
obstruction before us like chaff, until we encountered
wi' that wee wudden goddity; when, to stop our
advance (I saw it as plain as peas), the creature whirled
aff its perch, and flew crack against the midriff of me,
Saunders, like a stane frae a <i>testudo</i>&mdash;Hoot, no, of
Jack Lennox, I mean."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"My good friend," said I, "you must be very
ill&mdash;compose yourself."  Then aside to one of the men,
"Are you sure Lennox is not tipsy?"  The poor
fellow overheard me.
</p>

<p>
"Tipsy! me foo!" and he lay back and drew a
long breath like a porpoise.  He immediately
continued&mdash;"Ay, and I believe I am foo after all&mdash;but
wha may ye be that taunts me thereanent sae
unceremoniously, and me mair than half dead?  It was
na <i>yeer</i> siller that slokened me, I'se warrant, if foo I
am&mdash;Foo!&mdash;sma' manners have ye to taunt a puir
chiel like me with being foo&mdash;my certie, whisky maun
hae been plentier than gentlemen among us the day;
or foo I neer wad hae been&mdash;Foo!"
</p>

<p>
I was now much interested about the poor fellow,
and as I incommoded the wounded man who lay in the
cot next him to port, I moved round to the other
side, and again addressed our eccentric friend.  "Now,
my good man," said I, "I don't want to teaze you;
but as the doctor says he has great doubts of you, I
again ask you if I can do any thing for you; have
you any bequest to leave?"
</p>

<p>
"I say, freen'," rapped out the poor fellow, "the
doctor may go be damned,"&mdash;this was certainly very
plain, if not very complimentary;&mdash;"and it will not
break my heart if ye're no that far ahint him.  But I
shall live to dance at his <i>dregy</i>[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>] yet.  What can he
say to a man like me?  But you, sir, it was you
that accused me of getting drunk&mdash;and drunk I may
be after all, for my head sooms most awfu'."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The poor creature's mind was now utterly a
wool-gathering.  Presently he called out, "I say, my lad,
what are you abusing that brute beast for?  Haud aff
the dog, sir&mdash;that's the beast that wanted to worry
Mr Brail; but never mind, dinna massacre him, noo
since you have ta'en him&mdash;never abuse a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
I began to get tired of this, and was about moving
from where I stood, and going on deck, when, on
turning round, I found the ladder had been unshipped
on purpose to afford access to some locker behind it,
and Sprawl and I, unless we had chosen to give
additional trouble to poor devils who were most of them
sufficiently <i>done</i> already, were obliged to remain a
little longer where we were.  Immediately after this
Lennox again sung out, "Neebour, can you tell me
whar about we are, eh?"&mdash;and before I could answer
he continued, "Hech, man, he's but a puir shilpit
cretur, that Brail lad."  I was half inclined to be
angry at this unceremonious opinion of my personal
qualifications, but to be thus apostrophized to my
face, was so very absurd, that I laughed in spite of
myself.  "A puir bit animal, sir," the man
continued&mdash;"and tak my word for it, Saunders Skelp's
word, that he must have been ony thing but gleg at
the uptak.  The chiel, I'se warrant, was slow, slow
at his lair&mdash;a kind of <i>yird taid</i> as it were&mdash;and what
the deevil that hairum-scairum captain of ours, Sir
Oliver, could see in the animal to take him to sea
with him, I'm sure I canna tell.  But then the
commodore is siccan a throughither kind o' chap himsell,
that when ane has time to reflect on't, there is nay
miracle in his drawing to this camsteerie callant,
Benjie Brail, after all."
</p>

<p>
I could no longer contain, so smothering my laughter
the best way I could, I left him, and was in the
act of ascending when I heard our friend Skelp again
maundering to himself.
</p>

<p>
"God, to have seen the birr with which the wee
deevil of a heathen god flew right through the air, and
gied me siccan a devel in the wame.  Hech, it is
ominous&mdash;vary ominous, and I'll die o't, I'll die o't."  Then,
as he hove about on the other tack, "it is maist awfu'
het in this cursed hole; oh for a green tree and a
cool breeze!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Tityre, tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A long pause.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, but it's chokey!"
</p>

<p>
I laughed outright, and so did Sprawl.  Saunders
noticed this, and in his delirium began to laugh too.
</p>

<p>
"What's that skirling like the curlew one moment,
and grunting like a nine farrow pig the other?  I
say, friend, what kittles ye sae?  Come here, my
wee man, come here;" and raising himself in his
hammock, he stared idly into my face, and then shook
his head violently.  "Heard ever any Christian the
like o' that?" said the poor corporal; "hear till
that," and he again walloped his <i>cabeza</i> from side to
side; "dinna ye hear hoo my brain is dried up and
knotted in my <i>cranium</i> by this vile fever?  Safe us,
it's a' into lumps like aitmeal in brose, and noo the
lumps have hardened into a consistence like
flint,&mdash;losh! how they rattle in my skull like chucky stanes
in a wean's rash-basket!"  Another shake of his
head.  "Ech, the very fire-sparks are fleeing from
my ee.  I wonder if they can be hardened ideas; at
ony rate they have struck fire frae ilk ither.  Do ye
ken I could write poetry the noo&mdash;I'll be up and
overboard, if you dinna haud me&mdash;I'll be up and
overboard."
</p>

<p>
Discreet even in his madness, he had given
warning and time for the hint to be taken by his
mess-mates, and he was now forcibly held down.
</p>

<p>
As he lay back he continued to murmur, "Oh,
puir Saunders Skelp, puir Saunders Skelp, that ye
should hae gotten yer death-blow frae a bloody wee
heathen god, and you the son of a minister's man&mdash;a
godly bairn of the Reformation!"  Then lifting his
head, as if his own exclamation had startled him,
"Saunders Skelp&mdash;wha ca's on Saunders Skelp&mdash;there
is nae Saunders Skelp here, I trow?  As for
you, ye wee blackened deevil," (me, Benjie Brail, viz.)
"Oh, man, if I had gotten the educating o' ye, my
taws wad hae driven mair lair intil ye at the but-end,
than ten Southern maisters wha appeal till the head."
</p>

<p>
Our attention was here diverted by the hail of the
look-out on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Boat, ahoy!"  A pause.  "Coming here?"  Still no answer.
</p>

<p>
I scrambled up the ladder, by this time replaced,
accompanied by Mr Sprawl and Lanyard, who,
during my idle palaver with the Scotch corporal, had
made an overhaul of all the poor fellows, and seen
every one's wants attended to.  When we came on
deck, we found a cluster of people at the aftermost
part of the felucca.  The moment we advanced, little
Binnacle said, "Some one has twice hailed us from
the water astern, sir, but we can make nothing of it.
We hear the voice, but we cannot see the man who
shouts, sir."
</p>

<p>
Both Davie Doublepipe and myself strained our
eyes to catch the object; for although it was a bright
moonlight overhead, yet astern of us the thick mist that
had rolled down the river, and still hovered in that
direction, concealed everything under its watery veil.
</p>

<p>
Presently we heard the splash of a paddle, and a
voice shouted out, "Oh, dis current, dis current!  I
never sall be able to stem him.  Send a boat to pick
me up; do&mdash;send a boat, massa."
</p>

<p>
This was one thing we begged to decline doing.
</p>

<p>
"My man, whoever you may be, you must shove
ahead, and get alongside yourself, for no boat shall be
sent to you until we make you out," sung out old Dick.
</p>

<p>
Here we could hear the creature, whatever it was,
puff and blow, and the splashing of the paddle became
louder, while every now and then it gave a thump
with its open palm on the side of the canoe, or
whatever it might be it was in.  At length a small dory,
as it is called in the West Indies, a tiny sort of canoe,
shot out of the fog, with a dark figure paddling with all
his might in the stern, while a slighter one was sitting
in the bow.  He was soon alongside, and who should
scramble on board but our friend the resetter.  He
took no notice of any of us, but, turning round,
stooped down over the side, and said something in an
African dialect, that I could not understand, to the
figure in the boat, who immediately handed up what
appeared to me to be a log of wood, which he put
away carefully beside the long-gun.  He then called
out again to the party remaining in the canoe to come
on deck, when a handsome young Eboe woman stepped on board.
</p>

<p>
"Now, captain," said our free-and-easy friend&mdash;"now,
captain, will you hab de goodness to hoist in
my dory?"
</p>

<p>
"And for what should I do that same?" said the
fourth lieutenant, a little taken aback by the fellow's
cool impudence.  "Little reason why I should not
knock you overboard, my darling, after the
transactions of this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Transaction, captain?  O, massa, I don't know
him; but dis I knows, if you hab got into one scrape
dis day, you desarve it&mdash;ah, very mosh."
</p>

<p>
A momentary feeling of irritation shot across Lanyard,
but the absurdity of the whole affair instantly
quelled it, and, in spite of himself, he could not help
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Clinker, take care of this man, and
the woman who is with him, will ye? and tell Jerry
to get supper in the cabin."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenants and I resumed our walk on the
confined deck of the little vessel for a quarter of an
hour, when the steward came and announced that
supper was ready.  We went below, where our
comforts in a small way had been excellently well
attended to; the lamp was burning cheerily, the small
table was covered with an immaculate table-cloth,
although none of the finest; and two well-filled
decanters of Teneriffe sparkled on the board, while a
beautiful junk of cold salt beef, and a dish of taties in
their skins, with the steam smoking up through the
cracks in them, and a large case-bottle of capital old
Jamaica, gave assurance of a small streak of comfort
after the disasters and fatigues of the day.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of potatoes, stop till I immortalize my
old mother's receipt.  "To dress a potato&mdash;<i>wash</i> it
well, but no <i>scraping</i>; at the thickest end cut off a
piece"&mdash;(I beg the dear old woman's pardon&mdash;<i>pace</i>)&mdash;"cut
off a piece the size of a sixpence.  This is the
safety-valve through which the steam escapes, and all
rents in the skin are thereby prevented&mdash;-just as the
aforesaid valve prevents a rupture in the steam-boiler;
and if you do this carefully, oh for the mealiness
(<i>maliness</i>) thereof!"
</p>

<p>
Lanyard had asked old Pumpbolt the master, little
Binnacle his only mid, the youngster who had
behaved so gallantly at the start, to sup with him;
along with Mr Marline, one of the master's mates of
the Gazelle; and young De Walden, another reefer
of the dear old barky, a most beautiful, tall,
handsome, although slightly framed, boy.  So far as I
can judge, the youngster stood about five feet ten.
He might have been more.  He had his shoes on,
but no stockings&mdash;very wide trowsers&mdash;no waistcoat
nor jacket, but a broad white-and-blue striped
shirt, folded very far back at the throat, and no
neckcloth.  He wore an enormously broad-brimmed straw
hat, with a black ribbon round it, in rather a natty
bow on the left side, while his loins were still girt
with his by no means maiden sword.  As I was
diving into the cabin through the small companion,
he came up to me&mdash;"Do you know, sir, that I
cannot sup with Mr Lanyard to-night?  I wish you
would ask him to excuse me, sir"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Master de Walden," said I, "I cannot;
you must come; I am sure a glass of wine will do
you good."
</p>

<p>
"I know, sir, I know, and am very much obliged
to you; but&mdash;but I have no clothes, sir.  I wet my
jacket this morning in weighing the stream-anchor,
and my only other one is so covered with mud, that
really I am unable decently to appear in it."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, never mind, boy; come down in any way
you choose."
</p>

<p>
We adjourned to the cabin.  Old David, as pleasant
a fellow as ever stepped, notwithstanding his
peculiarities; Dick Lanyard, a darling in his way;
Pumpbolt and myself sat down at one side of the table,
having first deliberately taken our coats off.  We
were confronted by little Binnacle, and the other
midshipmen, who came down immediately after.
Young de Walden sat in his trowsers and shirt, with
his black silk cravat tied only once round his neck,
and a red silk handkerchief round his waist.  The
dress set off the handsome young fellow's figure to
great advantage, the fineness of his waist giving a
splendid relief to the spread of his shoulders, while
his beautifully moulded neck, white as the driven
snow, contrasted strikingly with his noble but
sun-burnt countenance; while his hair curled in short
black ringlets far back on his large marble forehead.
</p>

<p>
The salt junk was placed on the table, and we all
began our operations with great zeal; the biscuit
vanished in bushelsful,&mdash;the boys were happy as
princes, the smallest, little Binnacle, becoming
talkative from the comfortable meal, and the exhilarating
effects of a stiffish glass of grog, when who should
walk into the cabin but Sergeant Quacco himself?
He had diversified his loveliness after a most
remarkable manner; first, he was naked as the day his
mother bore him, all to his waistcloth of red serge.  He
had sandals of coarse untanned leather on his feet, a
cross belt of black leather slung over his right
shoulder, which supported a bayonet without a sheath, and
into which the rust had eaten&mdash;the whole affair being
much honeycombed&mdash;while his broad chest and
brawny arms were tatooed in gunpowder or indigo,
with the most fantastic shapes.  On his head he wore
an old military shacko, the brass ornaments cruelly
tarnished, and carried a long wand of wild cane in his
hand, of the thickness of my thumb, and about ten
feet high, the top of which kept rasp, rasping,
slantingly against the roof of the low cabin as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, steward, what do you mean by this, that
you let these savages turn us out of house and home
in this manner?" cried the fourth lieutenant.&mdash;Then
addressing the interloper&mdash;"My fine fellow, you are
a little off your cruising ground, so be making
yourself scarce&mdash;Bolt&mdash;vanish&mdash;get on deck with you,
or I shall be after swearing a very ugly oath."
</p>

<p>
"Massa, massa," quoth the man, "easy for you
chuck me oberboard&mdash;nobody can say you shan't&mdash;but
only listen leetle bit, and I know you yousef
shall say my hargument good for someting."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, during which he civilly waited
for Lanyard to speak, when finding he had no
inclination to do so, he continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah I know, and I older man den you, massa;
people never should trike when dem blood is up,
unless in de case of fight for Kin Shorge.  Ah, alway
wait, massa, until you see and consider of de reason
of de ting."
</p>

<p>
The good-hearted fellow was rebuked before the poor
black savage; I suppose the latter saw it in his face,
for all at once he gathered courage, and approached
close to him, and placing his large black paw&mdash;I
noticed the palm was a dingy white&mdash;on his arm
between the elbow and wrist, he looked up into Dick's
face,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Massa, you have not got one wife?"
</p>

<p>
"No I have not."
</p>

<p>
"But, massa, you can fancy yourself to hab one wife."
</p>

<p>
Lanyard nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, den, I go on.  Suppose you hab one comfortable
house, plenty pig dere, yam grow all round,
orange tree blossom close to, plantain trow him cool
shadow over all, bending heavily in de breeze, over
de house; wid de fruit ready for drop into your mout,
when you look up at him; de leetle guinea pig squeak
here and snort dere; we hab pineapple and star-apple&mdash;oh,
wery sweet&mdash;de great corn (maise dem call
him) grow all round de house; pease cover him like
one vine; and your servants are working and singing,
and de comfortable sunshine is drying every ting,
and closing all de beautiful flowers in him sleepy
heat.  You yousef are sitting in your chair, wid some
small drop of grog, after you hab eat good dinner of
goat, and maybe one broiled fis; and just when you
take your pipe, light him, and put him into your
mout&mdash;crack&mdash;one musket-shot sing over your
head&mdash;you jomp&mdash;(who would not jomp?&mdash;Debil himself
would jomp)&mdash;and before you can tink&mdash;flash&mdash;one
sailor make blow at you wid him glass-clear cutlass.
And ah, massa, suppose de worstest to come, and dese
strangers to set fire to your quiet hut, after beating and
bruising <i>you</i>; and de flames begin to crackle and hiss
over de wery apartment where you know your wife
is, and are consuming all your goods at de same time;
and dem black people <i>were my goods</i>: for if you had
left we to oursef dis morning, I should have got two
hundred doubloon, and five hundred piece of check
clot, from de Spanish captain, for dose one hundred
and fifty slave; who," (his smile here might have been
the envy of the Fiend himself,) "to prevent dem from
being miserable as you call in Havanna, you hab sent
to be happy in heaven."  And he groaned in great
bitterness of spirit.
</p>

<p>
I was much struck with all this, and looked steadfastly
at the poor creature, who was standing right
opposite me with his arms folded, in all the dignity of
a brave man, who considers his fate sealed.  There
was a long pause.  When he next spoke, it was in a
low melancholy tone.
</p>

<p>
"De morning sun, when him first sparkle on de
waterdrop dat hang like diamond on de fresh green
leaf, shine on me dis wery morning, one reesh and
happy man&mdash;one leetle chief&mdash;master of all dem ting
I speak about.  White man-of-war peoples come.
Sun set in de west,&mdash;red trou de sickly fog, leaving
every wegitable yellow, and dry, and dusty&mdash;who him
shine on now&mdash;on me, Quacco, once more&mdash;aye, but
Quacco widout house, or home, or friend, or goods,
more as he hab on him back&mdash;on Quacco standing up
in him kin, desolate as one big large baboon de day
him new catch."  Here the poor fellow could no
longer control his feelings, but wept bitterly&mdash;after a
burst of grief, he continued, with a voice almost
inarticulate from intense emotion&mdash;"If all dis was pass
wid you, captain, in one leetle hot day, in one small
twelve hour!"  But his manhood once more rallied
in his bosom, and making a step towards Lanyard,
with all the native independence of a noble savage, he
said, laying one of his hands on his heart, "Yes,
massa, I ask you, had all dis happen to you, let alone
one poor black debil like myself, white man as you
is&mdash;Kin's officer as you is&mdash;Christian person on de
back of bote&mdash;can you put your hand where mine is
now, and say, dat your spirit would not have been
much move&mdash;dat it would not have been a bitter,
bitter ting to look back to what you was when dat sun
rose, and den to consider what his last light glanced
on?"  He now slowly drew his bayonet&mdash;I started at
the motion, and Sprawl half rose from his chair, and
seized the carving knife that lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
The man did not move a muscle, but continued
looking steadfastly in the fourth lieutenant's face,
while he placed the handle or pipe of the naked
weapon in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
"Massa," at length he said, coolly and deliberately,
"I am helpless and unarmed, and a poor drunken
rascal beside, and in your power&mdash;one moment and
you can make cut my troat."  Dick returned the
weapon, and signed to him to sheath it, which he
did&mdash;he then unexpectedly turned round to me&mdash;&mdash;"And
as for you massa, if I have ill used <i>you</i> dis day, you
know of de provocation&mdash;you best know what you
would have done in my place.  But, massa, bote for
we blood is red, and you should not forget dis ting,
dat one time dis forenoon it might hab been for you
place to hax Serjeant Quacco to save you from dem
brute beast on sore."
</p>

<p>
I was taken regularly aback, and blackie saw it; so
he now assumed an easier mien, as if conscious he had
made a favourable impression.
</p>

<p>
"But what brought you here, my good man?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"De fear of death," he promptly replied.  "It has
enter de foolis head of de blacks dat I was de cause of
de attack&mdash;dat I was in league wid you, being, as you
see, one Englis gentleman like yousefs."  (I had
great difficulty in maintaining my gravity at all
this.)  "So my wife dere creep to where I hide when de
evening come, and say"&mdash;here he took hold of Sprawl's
hand in both of his, and looked up tenderly into his
face&mdash;(any one having our friend Liston's countenance,
when the Beauty is shamming Bashful, painted
on the retina of his mind's eye, has a tolerable idea of
the expression of Davie's face.  Oh for an hour of
Wilkie to have caught the two cherubs as a
group!)&mdash;"'Quacco'&mdash;him say '<i>Hokey doodle doo</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"Say what?" quoth Sprawl, like to choke with
suppressed laughter&mdash;"Say what?"
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow regarded the lieutenant for some
time with the greatest surprise, murmuring aside,
"What can de good gentleman see to amuse him so
mosh?" then aloud, "Him say in de Eboe tongue,
'you old willain, your troat is to be slice dis wery
night.'&mdash;'De debil,' say I, '<i>Jooram junkee pop</i>, say
I; dat is, it shan't if I can help it.  So I bolt&mdash;run
away&mdash;launch dory&mdash;and here I is, Serjeant Quacco,
ready once more to serve his Majesty Kin Shorge&mdash;God
save de Kin!"
</p>

<p>
Here old Bloody Politeful fairly exploded into the
most uproarious mirth.  The negro looked at him in
great amazement for some time, until at length the
infection caught me, when blowing all my manners
to the winds, off I went at score after our friend.
The peculiarities of Davie Doublepipe's voice were
more conspicuous in his joyous moments, if that were
possible, than when he spoke calmly; and as he shouted
out, "I say, Benjie, <i>Jooram junkee pop</i>," in one tune,
and "Why, Lanyard, <i>Hokey doodle doo</i>," in the other,
the alternations were so startling to poor Quacco's ear,
that he looked at the lieutenant and then at me first
of all in great alarm, and with his eye on the door,
as if to ascertain that there was no impediment to a
rapid retreat.  At last he seemed to comprehend the
mystery, and caught the contagion of our mirth also,
shouting as loud as either of us&mdash;"What dem white
gentlemen can see to laugh at&mdash;what funny ting it
can be? ha, ha, ha&mdash;dat big one speak wery comical;
one time squeak squeak like one leetle guinea-pig, den
grunt grunt like de big boar; he must surely be two
mans tie up in one kin&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"  The negro
instantly saw the advantage he had gained over us,
in being the cause of so much merriment, and he
appeared determined not to lose it.  "So you shee,
massa Captain&mdash;you really mosh not be asame, after
all, to be shivel to me and my vife&mdash;who is here
cowering behind de door; I bring him dat you may
see him take care of, for de men dere forward don't
behave well&mdash;none at all."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr Serjeant," said Sprawl, "show the lady
in, and no more about it."  The man said something
in Eboe, and forthwith in stepped one of the most
startling apparitions that ever I witnessed.  It was a
tall, exquisitely formed young Eboe woman&mdash;fair
enough to have passed for a mulatto.  She wore
neatly worked grass buskins, that fitted round the
ankle, as close as a laced boot made by Gundry.  Her
only dress was composed of a long web of some sort
of native cloth, about a foot wide, and composed of
red, blue, and yellow stripes alternately.  Three or
four turns of it were wrapped round her loins, and
then an end hung down before, with a deep fringe of
the blended colours of the stripes; while the other
end was carried up from the right hip, across her back,
and brought over the left shoulder, where it was again
festooned, by being twined two or three turns round
the left arm; which, when she entered, was folded
across her bosom.  Her skin was thickly tatooed at
the waist, but her beautiful bosom was untouched;
all to a dark peak, that projected upwards, giving the
tatooing the appearance of a dark-coloured stomacher.
Her cheeks and forehead were also thickly marked,
but without impairing the beauty of the expression of
her bland, although African features&mdash;such an eye,
and such teeth!  She wore large gold ear-rings; and
anklets and armlets of solid silver.  Her head was
bound round with a large green or blue cotton shawl;
and there she stood, looking at us with the greatest
composure; totally unconscious of the unusualness of
her costume, or the scantiness thereof.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my good man, take a glass of grog, will ye? and
here, give your wife a glass of wine, and then go
and betake yourselves to rest, in the quietest corner
you can find.&mdash;Here, steward, see that Serjeant
Quacco and his wife are cared for&mdash;a corner forward
of some kind or another until morning."
</p>

<p>
"Never say such a ting, massa&mdash;de men were
unpleasant company&mdash;can't go to dem&mdash;so I bring my
vife to sleep wid you."
</p>

<p>
"Mighty obliged, master serjeant&mdash;but would
rather be excused, if it be the same thing to you."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, ho," laughed the savage&mdash;"I mean, massa,
dat you would permit we to sleep at foot of de ladder
dere, and not be obliged to go among de rude peoples
in de oder part of de sip."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, do as you please; but let me go and
secure a couple of hours' sleep, before the tide turns,
will ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, massa&mdash;would like to drink your health,
though, massa&mdash;Leetle more grog, please, massa."
</p>

<p>
"Not another drop, sir.&mdash;Steward, see Serjeant
Quacco and his wife safely bestowed under the ladder
there, and then fasten the door."
</p>

<p>
Here Quacco once more stuck his round head in at
the door.  "Massa, I beg one fowl to kill before de
fetish."
</p>

<p>
"Get along with you, sir&mdash;away."
</p>

<p>
Our black visitors finally disappeared, and I turned
round to look at my shipmates.  The first lieutenant
had fallen back, with his head resting against the
small side-berth, sound asleep, with a piece of beef on
his fork, the latter firmly clutched in his hands; Dick
Lanyard had fairly slipped down, until he hung by his
chin on the edge of the table, like a parrot suspended
by his beak; old Pumpbolt had slid off his chair
altogether, and was fast enough on the bare deck, with his
unquenched pipe sticking in his mouth; while the
poor little reefers had fallen forward with their heads
on the table; Dick Marline having actually dropped
with his nose into his plate, amongst the beef and
potatoes; and all snoring most melodiously.  We
were in truth completely done up; so, leaving our
friends stretched on the lockers and in the berths, and
bestowed as well as the slender means of the small
vessel permitted, I adjourned to the deck once more,
in my capacity of pilot, to see how the weather looked.
</p>

<p>
I then returned to the cabin, and having desired the
steward, who was comparatively fresh, to call me when
the tide turned, I offered up my short but
heart-warm prayer of thanksgiving to the God of my
fathers for his great mercy vouchsafed to me during
the past day; and imploring his gracious protection
during the coming night, I lay down in my berth,
where in a minute I was as sound asleep as the others.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
</h3>

<h4>
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SERJEANT QUACCO.
</h4>

<p>
I had scarcely, to my conception, been asleep at
all, when I was called again.  "If ever I practise the
calling of a pilot in this wide world after this!" said I
to myself as I stumbled, yawning and stretching,
about the confined cabin.
</p>

<p>
It might have been about eleven at night when I
got on deck.  There was a heavy ground-swell
tumbling in upon us over the bar, which made the little
vessel pitch violently.
</p>

<p>
"See all clear to cut away the kedge," said I.
</p>

<p>
But there was no need; for the swell that rolled
in was as yet deep, dark, and unbroken.  I looked
forth into the night, endeavouring by the starlight,
for the moon was obscured by a thick bank of clouds
in the eastern horizon, to distinguish the whereabouts
of the bar at the river's mouth, but all was black
flowing water, and there was no sound of breakers; so
I again went below, and in a minute slept as sound as
before.
</p>

<p>
I cannot precisely say how long I had been in the
land of dreams, when I was again roused by the
steward calling Mr Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Wadding"&mdash;this was the gunner of the little
vessel&mdash;"does not like the look of the weather, sir;
it has become somewhat threatening, and the felucca
is riding very uneasy since the tide has turned, sir."
</p>

<p>
The sharp jerking motion of the small craft corroborated
the man's account but too forcibly; and once
more I went on deck, accompanied by the lieutenant,
where I was a good deal startled by the scene before
me.  The ebb-tide was now running down, and past
us like a mill-stream; and the bar, which a couple of
hours before was all black and undistinguishable,
began now to be conspicuous, from a crescent of white
waves which shone even through the darkness; while
a deep and increasing hoarse murmur, "like thunder
heard remote," was borne up the river towards us on
the night wind.  The foaming breakers on the bar,
as the tide continued to fall, spread out; and in an
hour, the rush of the tide downwards, and the tumble
of the sea inwards, placed us, even at the distance of
our anchorage, in a regular cauldron of broken water,
where the little craft was knocked about as if she
belonged to nobody, while every moment I expected
the cable to part.
</p>

<p>
It was a regular snow-storm; the swell, broken on
the bar, roared into the river in splashing waves, which,
when the downward current dashed against them, flew
up in spouts, covering every thing with spray, that
was puffed away seaward like smoke by the sharp
land-breeze which had suddenly set down, counter-checking
in a moment the regular easterly trade-wind.
The little vessel was thus kicked here and yerked
there, as if it had been a cork in the midst of the
bubbling of a boiling pot.  Oh! how I longed for
daylight!  At length daylight came, and the sun began
to exhale the dank pestiferous vapours that towards
grey dawn had once more mantled over the water.
</p>

<p>
For an hour it was again so thick that we could see
nothing in the direction of the bar; but the noise of
the breakers continued to increase; and as the boats
alongside were by this time, notwithstanding all our
endeavours, half full of water, I feared that, even when
the tide began to answer again, we should be unable
to send one of them down to sound; so there we lay
in the miserable consciousness of having been foiled in
our object on the one hand, and with small prospect
of being able to get out to rejoin the frigate on the
other.  At length, towards seven o'clock, the mist
rose; the unwholesome smell of mud, and slime, and
putrifying vegetables was no longer perceptible, and
the glorious sun once more shone on the broad
expanse of rushing waters.  The mangrove-covered
banks became again distinctly visible and well-defined,
and the horizon seaward began to look blue, clear, and
cheery.  But all this while the bar was one bow of
roaring foam; that increased as the sea-breeze freshened,
and fairly stifled the <i>terral</i>, until there was not one
solitary narrow streak of blue water in the whole
breadth of the river's mouth.
</p>

<p>
Dick was pacing the deck in no small perplexity I
saw, debating in his own mind whether or not he
should send below and rouse out Mr Sprawl, when the
surgeon passed me.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, doctor."
</p>

<p>
He returned the salute.
</p>

<p>
"How are all the wounded this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"All doing well, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And Lennox, how is he?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right with him now, sir; but the poor
fellow is awfully ashamed at the exhibition his
messmates have told him he made yesterday.  He is much
better, however; and I hope will be out of his
hammock this forenoon, if the weather keeps fine."
</p>

<p>
I had a sort of anxiety to know, from my own
observation, how the poor fellows were getting on; so I
followed our friend, and descended with him in his
visit to the sick and hurt.
</p>

<p>
Almost the first man I spoke to was Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to find you so much better, my man; I hope
you feel yourself stronger this morning?"
</p>

<p>
A faint blush spread over the poor fellow's thin
wasted features, and he hesitated in his answer.  At
length he stammered out&mdash;"Thank you, sir; I am
much better, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Who is that blocking up the hatchway?"' said
the doctor, as some dark body nearly filled the entire
aperture.
</p>

<p>
Presently the half-naked figure of Serjeant Quacco
descended the ladder.  He paid no attention to me, or
any body else; but spoke to some one on deck in the
Eboe tongue, when his wife appeared at the coamings
of the hatchway, hugging and fondling the identical
and most abominable little graven image we had seen
in the fetish hut, as if it had been her child&mdash;her
own flesh and blood.  She handed it down to the black
Serjeant, who placed it in a corner, nuzzling, and
rubbing his nose all over it, as if he had been propitiating
the tiny Moloch by the abjectness of his abasement.
I was curious to see how Lennox would take all this,
but it produced no effect: he looked with a quizzical
expression of countenance at the figure for some time,
and then lay back in his hammock, and seemed to be
composing himself to sleep.  I went on deck, leaving
the negro and his sable helpmate below amongst the
men, and was conversing with Mr Sprawl, who had
by this time made his appearance; when we were
suddenly startled by a loud shriek from the negress, who
shot up from below, plunged instantly overboard, and
began to swim with great speed towards the shore.
She was instantly followed by our friend the serjeant,
who for a second or two looked forth after the sable
naiad, in an attitude as if the very next moment he
would have followed her.  I hailed the dingy
Venus&mdash;"Come back, my dear&mdash;come back."  She turned
round with a laughing countenance, but never for a
moment hesitated in her shoreward progress.
</p>

<p>
"What sall become of me!" screamed Serjeant
Quacco&mdash;"Oh, Lord, I sail lose my vife&mdash;debil fetch
dem sailor buccra&mdash;cost me feefty dallar&mdash;Lose my
vife I&mdash;dat de dam little fetish say mosh be save.  Oh,
poor debil dat I is I"&mdash;and here followed a long tirade
in some African dialect, that was utterly unintelligible
to us.
</p>

<p>
"My good fellow, don't make such an uproar, will
ye?" said I.  "Leave your wife to her fate: you
cannot better yourself if you would die for it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, massa; I don't know.  Him cost
me feefty dallar.  Beside, as massa must have seen,
him beautiful! oh, very beautiful!&mdash;and what you
tink dem willain asore will do to him?  Ah, massa,
you can't tell what dem will do to him?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, my good man, what <i>will</i> they do?"
</p>

<p>
"Eat him, massa, may be; for dey look on him as
one who now is enemy&mdash;dat is, dey call me enemy,
and dey know him is my vife&mdash;Oh, Lord&mdash;feefty
dallar&mdash;all go, de day dem roast my vife."
</p>

<p>
I could scarcely refrain from laughing; but on the
instant the poor fellow ran up to the old quartermaster,
who was standing near the mast, admiring the
construction of the canoe,&mdash;as beautiful a skiff, by
the way, as was ever scooped out of tree.  "Help
me, old man; help me to launch de canoe.  I must
go on sore&mdash;I must go on sore."
</p>

<p>
The seaman looked at me&mdash;I nodded; and, taking
the hint, he instantly lent Blackie a hand.  The canoe
was launched overboard, and the next moment Serjeant
Quacco was paddling after his adored, that had
cost him fifty dollars, in double-quick time.
</p>

<p>
He seemed, so far as we could judge, to be rapidly
overtaking her, when the little promontory of the
creek hid them from our view; and under the
impression that we had seen the last of him, I began to
hug myself in the hope of getting over the bar that
forenoon.  An hour might have elapsed, and all
remained quiet, except at the bar, and even there the
thunder and hissing of the breakers began to fail.  As
the tide made, Lanyard saw all ready to go to sea;
but I was soon persuaded, that, from the extreme
heaviness of the ground swell that rolled in, there
was no chance of our extricating ourselves until the
evening at the soonest, or it might be next morning,
when the young ebb would give us a lift; so we were
walking up and down, to while away the time, when
poor Lennox, who had by this time come on deck,
said, on my addressing him, that he had seen small
jets of white smoke rise up from among the green
mangroves now and then; and although he had not
heard any report, yet he was persuaded they indicated
musket-shots.
</p>

<p>
"It may all be as you say, Lennox; but I hope
we shall soon be clear of this accursed river, and then
they may blaze away at each other as much as they
please."
</p>

<p>
The words were scarcely out of my mouth, when
we not only saw the smoke, but heard the rattle of
musketry, and presently a small black speck shot
rapidly beyond the headland or cape, that shut in our
view, on the larboard side, up the river.
</p>

<p>
On its nearer approach, we soon perceived that it
was our friend Quacco once more, in his small dory
of a canoe, with the little fetish god stuck over the
bow; but there was no appearance of his wife.
</p>

<p>
As he drew closer to the vessel, the man appeared
absolutely frantic.  He worked and sculled away
with his paddle as if he had been mad; and when at
last he got on deck, having previously cast the little
horrible image up before him, he began to curse
and to swear, at one moment in the Eboe tongue, at
another in bad Creole English, as if he had been
possessed with a devil&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hoo chockaro, chockaro, soo ho</i>&mdash;Oh, who could
tink young woman could hab so mosh deceit!&mdash;<i>Ah,
Queykarre tol de rot jig tootle too&mdash;to leave me
Quacco, and go join dem Eboe willain</i>!"  Then, as if
recollecting himself&mdash;"But how I do know dat dem
no frighten him for say so?  Ah, now I remember
one ogly dag stand beside him hab long clear knife in
him hand.  Oh, Lord!  <i>Tooka, Tooka&mdash;Cookery
Pee Que</i>&mdash;Ah, poor ting! dem hab decoy him&mdash;cheat
him into dem power&mdash;and to-morrow morning sun
will see dem cook him&mdash;ay, and eat him.  Oh dear,
dem will eat my vife&mdash;oh, him cost me feefty dallar&mdash;eat
my feefty dallar&mdash;<i>oh Kickereboo&mdash;Rotan</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And straightway he cast himself on the deck, and
began to yell and roll over and over, as if he had been
in the greatest agony.  Presently he jumped on his
legs again, and ran and laid hold of the little graven
image.  He caught it up by the legs, and smashed its
head down on the hard deck.  "You dam fetish&mdash;you
false willain, dis what you give me for kill fowl,
eh? and tro de blood in you face, eh? and stick
fedder in you tail, eh? and put blanket over you
shoulder when rain come, and night fog roll over we and
make you chilly?  What you give me for all dis?
You drive me go on board dam footy little Englis
cruiser, and give my vife, cost me feefty dallar, to be
roast and eat?  Oh, Massa Carpenter, do lend me
one hax;" and seizing the tool, that had been brought
on deck and lay near him, he, at a blow, split open
the fetish's head, and continued to mutilate it, until he
was forcibly disarmed by some of the men that stood
by him.
</p>

<p>
After this the poor savage walked doggedly about
the deck for a minute or two, as if altogether irresolute
what to do; at length he dived suddenly below.
</p>

<p>
"Breakfast is ready, sir," said the boy who acted
the part of steward; and Lanyard, having asked me
to accompany him, descended to do the honours to his
company&mdash;rather a large party, by the way, for the
size of the small cabin.
</p>

<p>
We all made the best use of our time for a quarter
of an hour; at length little Binnacle broke ground.
</p>

<p>
"We have been hearing a curious history of this
black fellow, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What was it?  Little good of him you could
have heard, I should have thought," quoth Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no great harm either," said young De
Walden, who now chimed in, with his low, modest,
but beautifully pitched voice&mdash;"We have had his
story at large, sir, this morning, after the decks were
holystoned and washed down."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Master De Walden, give it us then," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir," said the beautiful boy, "no one
can do justice to it but himself."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I call him, sir?" said Mr Marline.
</p>

<p>
I looked enquiringly at old Davie Doublepipe, as
much as to say, Are those boys quizzing us now?
"What say you, Sprawl, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not, man&mdash;why not?" replied my
excellent coadjutor.  "If it were only to amuse the lads,
surely there is no harm in it.  But here, give me
another cup of coffee,&mdash;and, Master Marline, the wing
of that spitchcock chicken, if you please&mdash;Why, Brail,
if nothing else thrives in that most damnable <i>Sierra
Leone</i>, fowls do."
</p>

<p>
While the lieutenant was employed in completing
his stowage&mdash;no regular <i>Stevedor</i> could have gone
more scientifically about it&mdash;little Binnacle ushered
in our dark friend.  What a change in his outward
man!  Where he had got his garments heaven knows,
but there was the frantic barbarian of half an hour
ago, newly and freshly rigged in a clean pair of duck
trowsers, canvass shoes, and a good check shirt, with
his never-failing black belt slung across his right
shoulder, and supporting the rusty bayonet, already
mentioned.  He drew himself up at the door, soldier
fashion, and put his hand to his cap.  The light from
the small scuttle above shone down strong on his
tatooed countenance, and lit up his steady bronze-like
features.  I waited in expectation of his speaking.
But the talkative savage of yesterday evening had
now subsided into the quiet orderly soldier.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Serjeant Quacco," at length <i>quod</i> Davie
Doublepipe, as he finished his ham, and swallowed
his last cup of coffee, "we have been hearing from
these young gentlemen that you have a story to tell;
have you any objections to oblige us with it again?"
</p>

<p>
This flourish of trumpets was lost on poor Quacco.
He stared vacantly, first at one, and then at the other,
but remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"What you tell dem young gentlemen about who
you is?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," promptly rejoined Serjeant Quacco, "is
dat de ting massa dere want to know?  I shall tell
him over again, if massa choose, but it is one very
foolis story."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said I, "let us have it again, by all
means."
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow, after endeavouring to look as
serious as possible, and giving sundry hems and haws,
and looking unutterable things, as if in doubt whether
we were in jest or no, began his story.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SERJEANT QUACCO.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," began our dark friend, "I tink it
very proper dat you read dis certificate before I say
more&mdash;proper you should be perswade dat I was one
person of consequence, before we proceed farder."  Whereupon
he handed a small flat tin box to Davie
Doublepipe.
</p>

<p>
"Read, Sprawl," said I,&mdash;"read."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant took off the lid, and produced a
ragged piece of paper, which, after some trouble in
deciphering, he found to contain the following words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I certify, that the bearer, Corporal Quacco, late
of H.M. &mdash;&mdash; West India regiment, has received
his discharge, and a free passage to the coast of Africa,
whither he has desired to return, in the first of his
Majesty's ships that may touch here, belonging to
that station; in consequence of his gallantry and
faithful conduct during the late mutiny, wherein
Major D&mdash;&mdash; unfortunately lost his life."  I forget
the name and rank of the officer who signed it.
</p>

<p>
"So you see, gentlemen, dat I is Kin's hofficer
same as youselves, although on the retired list.  Let
me tell what you shall hear now.  Twenty year ago,
I was catch in de Bonny river, and sold to one nice
captain from Livapool.  He have large ship, too much
people in him&mdash;a tousand&mdash;no&mdash;but heap of people.
He was nice man, until him get to sea&mdash;was debil
den&mdash;cram we into leetle, small, dam dirty hole&mdash;feed
we bad&mdash;small time we get to breath de fresh air on
deck, and plenty iron on we legs, and clanking chain
on we neck, and <i>fum, fum</i>&mdash;dat is floggee&mdash;I sall not
say where.  But soon we come widin two week of
West Indy&mdash;ho! food turn wery much better&mdash;we
get more air&mdash;palm oil sarve out to we, to make we
skin plump and nice.
</p>

<p>
"So, to make one long story short, we arrive at
Jamaica, and ten of de best-looking of we"&mdash;(here the
black serjeant drew himself up)&mdash;"were pick out&mdash;select,
you call&mdash;by one hofficer, and dat day we were
marshed to Fort Augusta, to serve his Majesty as
soldiers in de grenadier company of de &mdash;&mdash; West
India regiment.  Long time pass over.  We all pick
up de Englis language&mdash;some better, some worser;
for all peoples cannot expect to pronounce him so well
as Serjeant Quacco."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"And we drill, drill, drill, every day, and marsh
and countermarsh, and wheel and halt, until we are
quite proficient.  I was now one corporal.  Cat never
touch my back;&mdash;never get dronk&mdash;dat is, except I
know I can lie in hammock widout neglect my duty
until I get sober again.  My captain say, I was de best
man in de company&mdash;and I tink so too myself, so de
captain must have been right; and some good mans
were amongst we, gentlemen&mdash;ah, and some wery bad
ones also.
</p>

<p>
"We were, on a certain day, to have great inspection;
so de fag, and work, and drill, become double
for some time before we expect de general.  De idle
dogs say, 'What use dis? we quite perfect; no white
regiment can manoeuvre better den we.'  But I say,
'Never mind, will soon be over, so rest content.'&mdash;'Ah,'
say one bitter bad fellow&mdash;Ogly Jack, dem call
him&mdash;not wery genteel name, gentlemen, but can't
help dat&mdash;'Ah,' say Jack, 'if de rest of de regiment
was like me, you should see!  Soon we should have
our own way; and plenty tousand of de poor
field-people would soon join us.'&mdash;'Ho, ho!' say I,
Quacco, 'mutiny dis;&mdash;bloody murder and sudden death
dis is;&mdash;so, Master Ogly Jack, I shall take de small
liberty to wash you.'  However, de inspection pass
over; noting particular happen until de evening,
about nine o'clock.  De tattoo beat done long time,
and I was eating my supper, at de end of de long
gallery of de easternmost barrick, wery comfortable;
looking out on de white platform below, where de
sentries were walking backward and forward, singing
negro song; de clear arms every now and den
sparkling bright, cold, and blue, in de moonlight; and den
I look beyond all dis out upon de smoot shining
water of de harbour, which stretch away, bright as
polished silver, until it end in de lights at Port Royal,
and on board of de men of war, at anchor under de
batteries dere, dat twinkle and wanish, twinkle and
wanish, until de eye rest on de spark at de flag-ship's
mizen-peak, dat shone steady as one Wenus star.
Suddenly I start&mdash;'What is dat?' I say, for I see canoe
steal gently along; de paddle seem of velvet, for no
noise it make, none at all.  Presently de parapet hide
him, and de two peoples I sees in de canoe, from
Quacco's sight.  'How de sentry don't hail?' say I,
Quacco&mdash;'What it can mean he don't hail?' again
say I.  But, just as I tink about de wonder of dis, one
loud laugh of de young buccra officer come from de
mess-house, and I say, 'Ah ha! de claret begin to
work dere&mdash;de brandy and water begin to tell; so I will
take my grog too, and turn in.'&mdash;'Hillo!' I say again;
for just at dis time I hear one footstep behind me;
'who go dere?'  No one speak for long time; but I
see one person, wid him head just above de level of de
gallery, standing on de stair.  I seized my fuzee.
'Come up, whoever you is.'&mdash;'Ha, ha!' laugh some
one.  'What, broder Quacco, are you afeard? don't
you know me Jack?  You know we are countrymen:
so here I have brought you a drop of grog.'&mdash;'Oh
ho!' say I Quacco, 'Jack, is it you?  Come in; I
shall strike a light.'&mdash;'No, no,' say Jack; 'I don't
want de oder men to see I am here.'  I tink dis wery
strange, but I say noting.  All quiet; de rest of my
company were at de oder side of de barrick, most of
dem in der hammock already, and I was not wery
fond to be alone wid Jack after what I overhear.  Yet
de grog was very good.  I take anoder pull; it grew
better, so I take one small drop more.  'Now, Jack,'
say I, 'no offence, but you must know I tought you
were leetle better den one big dam rogue; but I
begin to tink'&mdash;(here him smile quite pleasant,
and give me oder small drop)&mdash;'dat you are not
quite so big willain as I was led to believe; so
shake hands.'  He held out him's large paw, and say
he, 'Oh, I know, Quacco, dat some one was prejudice
you against me; but, never mind, I know of some
fun going on.  Ah, handsome black girls dere, Quacco,
and Mundingo Tom, and Yellow-skin Paul, so come
along.'&mdash;'Come along?' say I, Quacco; 'where de
debil you want me to go at dis time of night?  De
gate all shut; can't come.'  Here him laugh loud
again.  Oh, if dat Ogly Jack had only had white face,
I would have tought he was de wery debil himself.
'De gate shut?' say he, 'to be sure de gate is shut;
but come here, man, come here;'&mdash;and now I was
sure he was Obeah man, for I had no power to stay
behind&mdash;something seem draw me.  Massa, you hab
all see snake wheedle leetle bird into him jaw, and
just so dis dam Jack work on me, Quacco.  To be
sure de rum was wery good, wery good indeed; so I
follow him down stair, and as we pass dat part of de
barrick where de grenadier were, we meet two tree
men; but no notice take dem of we; so we go down
to de esplanade.  All still dere but de loud 'Ha, ha!'
from de mess-room, where de band was play, and wax-lights
shine.  No one else stir, except sentry over de big
heap of shell,&mdash;one large pile of ten, twelve, tirteen
inch shell dat was heap up in de middle of de fort,&mdash;so
we turn to de left, and ascend de platform.  'Who go
dere?' sing out de sentry, as him walk backward and
forward between de two gun facing we; 'Who go
dere?' say he.  Jack spring forward to de sentry, and
say something.  I could not hear what he whisper;
but, though I speak never one word, de man mediately
say, 'Pass, friend!' and den him stomp away in
de oder direction from where we was.  Jack now take
hold of my hand,&mdash;'No time for lost; so come along,
broder Quacco.'  I hold me back.  'Ah ha!' say I,
'show me de cause for all dis, Massa Jack.'  'And
so Jack shall,' him say&mdash;'but come here, man, come
here;' and he lead me into de embrazure of one long
four-and-twenty; and taking one good strong rope
out of de muzzle of de gun, where him seem to have
been stow on purpose, him make one loop in him and
hook him over de leetle nose dat stick out from de
breech of him behind.  'Now, Quacco, I know you
is clever fellow; so warp yourself down by dis
rope&mdash;dere is no wet ditch here&mdash;so down you go,
and'&mdash;&mdash;'Gently,' say I, 'where we go to?&mdash;tell a me dat.'&mdash;'I
will,' say he, 'but de night air chill, so here take
anoder drop'&mdash;and, lord, we have de oder pull at de
case bottle.  Him puff one long puff after him drink.&mdash;'I
see you suspicious wid me still,' him say, 'but only
come de length of de old hut in de cashaw bush dere,
and you shall see I is true man.'&mdash;Here I stand back
leetle piece to remember myself&mdash;but he would give
me no time to tink none at all&mdash;'You coward fellow,
come along,' say Jack&mdash;'here go me.'&mdash;Wid dat him
let himself down by de rope.&mdash;'Coward! nay, me is
no coward&mdash;so here go me Quacco'&mdash;and down I slid
after him.  We reach de bottom.  'Now follow me,'
say Jack.  Presently we come to de hut in de wood,
but many a time I look back to see de glance of de
sentry musket before him fire; but no one so much as
hail we&mdash;so we walk, or rader run, along de small
path, troo de cashaw bushes dat lead to de hut&mdash;de
moonshine flicker, flicker on de white sandy path,
troo de small leaf of de cashaw, no bigger as, and
wery like, de leaf of de sensitive plant.&mdash;Ah, Massa
Brail,"&mdash;I was smiling here,&mdash;"I know him name&mdash;I
know de sensitive plant&mdash;often get tenpence from
young buccra hofficer to hunt him out for him, and?
indeed, I know where whole acres of him grow in
Jamaica.  But you put me out, Massa Brail&mdash;where I
was?&mdash;oh&mdash;de moonshine shine bright and clear, and
de lizard whistle <i>wheetle, wheetle</i>, and de tree-toad
snore, and de wood-cricket chirp, and de beetle moan
past we, and de bat whir, and de creech howl
squake&mdash;So tink I, I wish I was once more in de barrick&mdash;but
no help for it.  Presently we were in front of de
hut.  Small black ogly hut him was&mdash;no light could
be seen in him&mdash;at least none shine below de door&mdash;and
dere was never no window in him none at all.
Jack stop, and put him hand to de latch.  I lay hold
of him arm.  I say, 'Massa Jack, is dis de hut you
speak of, and dis de pleasant peoples I was to see, and
de nice black girls, eh?'&mdash;'Stop,' say he, 'don't judge
until you see&mdash;but come in, man, come in.'&mdash;I go in,
but Jack was close de door instantly behind him.  'Hilo,
what mean you by dat?' say I, 'you go leave me
here widout fire?'&mdash;'Poo,' say he, 'fire? you shall
soon have enough.'  Wid dat him strike one light, den
light some chip, and presently him tro someting on de
fire, dat make it blaze up into one large blue flame dat
make every ting look wery disagreab&mdash;oh, mosh wery.
Jack sit down&mdash;he take piece roast pork, some yam,
and some salt fis out of de crown of him shako&mdash;we
eat&mdash;de rum bottle soon not heavy too much in de
hand&mdash;and I forget, sinner dat I is, dat I should hab
been in my bed in de barrick in de fort&mdash;so Jack, after
poke de fire again, say, 'Quacco, broder Quacco; as I
say before, we is countrymen&mdash;bote Eboe, is we?'&mdash;'Yes,'
say I, 'we is Eboe, but we were wery different
peoples in de Eboe country.  You know, Jack, dat I
was poor debil whose fader and moder was kill and
carry away by dese dam Felatahs and'"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here friend Dick interrupted the thread of our friend
Quacco's tale.  "I say, serjeant, you are speaking of
Felatahs&mdash;we have heard much of them on the
coast&mdash;who and what are they, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall tell massa," said Serjeant Quacco.  "Dam
troublesome fellow dem Felatah&mdash;never stay at
home&mdash;always going about fighting here&mdash;stealing dere.
You go to bed&mdash;hear de pig in de oder end of your hut
grunt quite comfortable&mdash;you wake&mdash;him gone&mdash;'ah,
Felatah must have been dere.'  You hab only two
wife, so you go into market&mdash;bazar, de Moorish people
call him&mdash;you buy anoder leetle wife, because maybe
one of de two grow old, and de oder grow stupid
maybe; well, you bring de leetle wife home&mdash;nice
leetle person&mdash;you tell him de story how Felatah come,
while you sleep, and tief pig&mdash;ha, ha&mdash;you laugh, and
he laugh, and you drink small piece of tody, after nyam
supper, and go werry merry to bed&mdash;ho&mdash;you wake
next morning&mdash;debil&mdash;him gone too well as de pig&mdash;de
leetle wife gone&mdash;oh, lord&mdash;'sure as can be, Felatah
must be dere.'  And your bag of cowrie never safe&mdash;every
ting dat cursed Felatah can lay him fist on, him
grab&mdash;de Livapool ship people call him Scotchman."
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell that part of your story in the hearing
of Corporal Lennox, friend Quacco," said I, laughing.
</p>

<p>
He grinned, and proceeded.  "I say to Jack, 'I was
catch when I was leetle naked fellow by de Felatahs, wid
my fader and moder, and carry off to dem country, and
afterward sell for slave; but you was great man
always&mdash;big fetish priest you was&mdash;many fetish you make
in your time; you kill goat and pig before de
fetish.'&mdash;'Ay,' said Jack, 'and maybe, Quacco, I kill oder
ting you no dream of before de fetish, beside dem who
hab cloven hoof and four leg and one tail'&mdash;and he
rose up&mdash;on which me Quacco jump on my feet too.
'Massa Ogly Jack, I onderstand you now, you
willain; you is one mutiny, sir, and I arrest you, sir, in
de name of de Kin.'  All dis time I was press de tumb
of my left hand against de pipe of my bayonet to see
dat him was loose in de sheath.  Jack again throw
someting into de fire, dat dis time flare up wid red
flame, not wid blue one as before, when every
ting&mdash;de roof, de leetle wildcane bed, de rafter, and whole
inside of de hut, de calabash hang against de wall, all
look red, red and glowing hot, as if we had plump
into de bad place all at once&mdash;even Jack, and me
Quacco, seem two big lobster.  I was wery terrible
frighten, and drew back to de corner as far as I could
get.  Jack did not follow me, but continued standing
in de same spot where he had risen up, wid both hand
stretch out towards me.  I try for speak, but my troat
stop up, as if you was plug him wid piece of plantain.
'Quacco,' at length say Jack wery slow, like one
parson, 'Quacco, you have say I was fetish man, and
hab kill goat and pig&mdash;and I say I was so; and dat I
have in my time make fetish of oder ting dat have no
cleft in him hoof, and hab not four leg, nor one tail.
Listen to me, Quacco; you is not goat?'&mdash;'No,' say
me Quacco, 'certainly I is not goat.'&mdash;'You is not
pig?' continue Jack.&mdash;'No, no&mdash;Oh! oh! oh!' groan
me Quacco again&mdash;'You hab not cloven foot?' him
go on to say.&mdash;'No,' roar I.&mdash;'Nor four leg?'&mdash;'No,'
again me roar, shaking out my two foot for make him
see.&mdash;'Nor one tail?'&mdash;Here I get mad wid fear, and
jump forward wid my drawn bayonet right upon Jack&mdash;but,
fiz, as if water had been thrown on it, out goes
de fire.  I nearly stifle wid de smoke, but determined
to grapple wid Jack.  I tumble all about de hut, but
no Jack dere; I try de door&mdash;all fast.  What shall
I do?&mdash;he vanish&mdash;he must be debil&mdash;and I retreat
de best way I could, groping along de wall,
until I once more get into de corner dat I was leave.
'Oh, my God'' say me Quacco, 'here I sall be
murder&mdash;or if I be not murder, den I sall be flog for being
out of barrick widout leave&mdash;Oh, poor me Quacco,
poor me Corporal Quacco&mdash;oh, to be flog at de
triangles would be one comfort, compare wid walk to
de hell place in dis fashion!'  'Quacco,' say one voice,
it was not Jack voice, 'Quacco.'&mdash;'Hillo,' say I, 'who
de debil is you next, eh?'  No hanswer&mdash;den I begin
to ruminate again.  'Quacco,' again de voice
say.&mdash;'Hillo,' again say I, frighten till de sweat hop, hop
over my forehead, and den from my chin and de point
of my nose,"&mdash;("Where may that be?" whispered
little Binnacle)&mdash;"when it drop down on de floor like
small bullets.  'Quacco.'&mdash;'Oh, oh, oh!' groan I;
for dis time it sound as if one dead somebody was
speak out of one hollow coffin, lying at de bottom
of one new open grave; 'put you hand at you
feet, and see what you catch dere, and eat what you
catch dere.'  I did so&mdash;I find one calabash, wid
boil nyam, and piece salt pork dere; I take him
up&mdash;taste him&mdash;wery good&mdash;eat him all&mdash;-why not?
'Quacco,' again say de voice, 'grope for de calabash
dat hang against de wall.'  I do so&mdash;quite heavy&mdash;let
me see.  'Drink what in him,' again say de
debil&mdash;'To be sure, Massa Debil,' say I, 'why not?'  I
taste him&mdash;good rum&mdash;ah, ah, ah&mdash;wery good rum,
when flash de fire again blaze up right cheery, but I
see no one; so I begin to look about, and de first ting
I do was to put down my hand where I had replaced,
de calabash at my feet.  Mercy Heaven! what I lift?
One skull, fresh and bloody, of one dead shild, wid some
dirt at de bottom, and some fedders, and de shell of one
egg.  'Oh, oh, oh! obeah, obeah!' shout I.  And de
calabash, what him contain?  I pour out some on de
fire&mdash;blaze, whatever it was&mdash;blaze up in my face and singe
my hair, oh, wery mosh&mdash;make my head smell like
de sheep head de Scotch agitant sarvant boil for him
massa dinner on Sunday, when him too sick to dine
at de mess.  'Dis will never do,' say I Quacco;
'let me see what stuff dis can be I was drink;' and
I pour some on de white bench beside de fire.  Oh,
mammy Juba&mdash;O&mdash;O&mdash;O&mdash;<i>it was blood</i>!  And
what is dat small black box I see below de bench?
I capsize him.  'Debil,' say I Quacco, 'what him
is?'  Massa, it was one leetle coffin tree feet long,
wid de grave-clothes in him, but green and festering
as if de rotting dead picaninny had been new remove.
'Quacco,' again say dat terrible voice, 'what you eat
for yam was dirt from your fodder's grave, Quacco&mdash;look
at him.'&mdash;'Oh, oh,' again roar I; 'but, good
Massa Debil, who go to Africa for him, eh?'&mdash;'Hold
your peace and be dam,' say de voice; 'and what you
drink for rum, was your moder's blood; so, Quacco, you
mosh swear to keep Jack secret, and to help him, and
to do whatever him tell you, even if it be to shoot
your hofficer.'&mdash;Here I go mad altogeder&mdash;I dance
about de fire&mdash;whip, in one second it go out
entirely&mdash;I jump up and down&mdash;de voice still continue to
sing out&mdash;oder two voice sing out along wid him,
'Where dem evil spirit can be conceal?' say I&mdash;'some
one must be on de rafter, couple you call, of de
roof above my head calabash, for I can't find no debil
on de floor of de hut, none at all,' say I; so I jomp
up again, when my head knock against someting.
'Oh,' say somebody.  'Ah,' say me, Quacco.  I leap
once more, and pike up my naked bayonet before me&mdash;It
tick in someting&mdash;what it was I can't tell; it
feel as if I had dig him into one rump of beef&mdash;large
yell instantly shake de entire hut&mdash;I jump again&mdash;heavy
ting fall down on me&mdash;I scramble to get away,
but one of de debils scramble to hold me down&mdash;I
turn to de left&mdash;I lay hold of de hand of anoder on
dem&mdash;no doubt de one who was speak.  'Ho, ho,' say
I Quacco; so I make clever slide from between dem.
De two debils grapple one anoder&mdash;gurgle, gurgle&mdash;squeak,
squeak&mdash;one on dem was strangling de oder.
I almost laugh, when some one hit me a heavy blow
behind de ear; I faint away&mdash;dead&mdash;and&mdash;and I
remember noting none at all, until I find myself, when,
still it was dark night, all beat and bruise, and wid
swimming head, in my hammock in de barrick at
Fort Augusta.  I sleep sound till near daybreak,
however, when I turn myself, and say, 'Hab I
Quacco been dronk last night?'  I tink so; 'Or has all
dis been one dream?'  Maybe.  Den I put up my
hand to my head, but I never get soch bumps and
tumps in one dream before.  Dere was only tree oder
of our men sleep in dat end of de barrick where I
was, de rest being two rooms off, dose between us
being under repair; one on dem was Ogly Jack, and
de oder two was de wery dentical rascail I have
mention before, Mundingo Tom and Yellow-skin Paul&mdash;Dem
all tree eider were sound asleep, in dem hammocks,
or pretended dey were so&mdash;for when I feel de
cool damp morning breeze come troo de open window
at one side of de barrick-room and blow clean out
at de oder; and see de morning star twinkle bright
and clear in de red east, and de pale-faced buccra
moon, just sinking behind de brushwood on Hellshire
Point, troo de window opposite, I turn myshef
again in my hammock, and listen to de roar of de
surf in de distance, and rub my eyes again, and say
'it not morning yet,'&mdash;But presently de trute push
himself into my eye, and I say 'It <i>is</i> daybroke, and
sore or sound, up must I Quacco get.'  Just under de
window, by dis time, I was hear some low grumbling
voices, and coughs, and loud yawns; den I hear
hollow tumbling sounds like when drum is place on de
ground; den more grumbles, and coughs, and yawns;
den de squeaking of de drum braces, as de leetle
drummer pull dem tight, and de tootletoo of de fifer,
as dem get all ready.  At length Old Spearpoint, de
drum-major, sing out wery gruff, 'fall in, music,' and
next minute roll went de drum, squeak went de fife;
roll went de drum, squea-eak went de fife very shrill;
roll went de drum de tird time, and squea-ea-eak
went de fife, very too dam shril dis last time; and
away dem stamp rum dum dum round de barrick-yard
wid dere reveillie.  We all tumble out, and fall
in on parade&mdash;still dark&mdash;we stand to our arms, de
moon go down, but de morning star glance cold and
clear on de bayonet and bright barrels of de
guns&mdash;de great Duke no was brown de barrel den, God bless
him.  Search arms,' de sergeant say.  We do so&mdash;half
pace to de right&mdash;so in dat position I see well
what Ogly Jack, who was my rear rank man, was do.
De Serjeant approach me&mdash;I send down my steel
ramrod wid one bang&mdash;he shomp up wid a loud ring
one foot out of my musket&mdash;it really surprise me
how far de ramrod shomp, as I send him home wid
scarcely no strength none at all.  'Ha, no for noting
my ramrod shomp so, someting past common here,'
say I to myshef&mdash;de next man to me in de front rank
was Yellow-skin Paul, and de next man to Ogly
Jack was Mundingo Tom.  As me Quacco was de
right hand man of de front rank of de grenadiers, so
Jack was de right hand man of de rear rank&mdash;well,
Yellow-skin Paul make believe dat him send him
ramrod home, but I notice he catch him between his
finger and tumb, so as he never reach de bottom.
'Ho, ho,' tink I to myself, 'who shall say dat gun
no load!'  I keep quite still&mdash;de Serjeant by and by
come to Jack&mdash;he catch de ramrod same way, and de
Serjeant being half asleep, eider did not notice dis, or
him tought noting about it.  Presently he desire
Mundingo Tom to search arms&mdash;he bang his ramrod
down I saw, wid design to catch him like de oders,
but in his hurry it slipt troo his fingers, and go home
<i>thud</i>.  'Ho, ho,' say I again to myself, 'dis piece is
also load'&mdash;What was to be do?&mdash;de Serjeant notice
dis one&mdash;'dat firelock is load, you scoundril.'&mdash;'No,'
say Mundingo Tom, 'but I leave some tow in him,
beg pardon, massa serjeant.'&mdash;'You dem rascail,' say de
serjeant, 'you never is better, you lazy dog&mdash;-fall out, sir,
and draw de'&mdash;&mdash;'Attention,' call out de agitant at
dis moment; 'de left wheel into line&mdash;marsh'&mdash;tramp,
tramp, tramp, whir&mdash;de line is form.  'Stand at
ease&mdash;A Serjeant from each company for blank
cartridges.'  So away step de serjeant, who had given
Mundingo Tom a rating, and I take de opportunity of
whisper Jack&mdash;'I say, Jack, what is in de wind?  I
have great mind to peach my sospicion.'  He say
nosing; and den I say, 'Poo, all my fear must be
nonsense&mdash;all must be a dream'&mdash;de serjeant return&mdash;serve
out eight round of blank cartridge&mdash;'attention'
again.  'De line will wheel into open column
of companies, right in front&mdash;on you left backwards
wheel&mdash;halt, dress.'  De hofficer was now all on
parade, and stood in a group in front&mdash;de agitant mount
him horse&mdash;Major D&mdash;&mdash; appear at de door of him
house&mdash;one orderly hold him horse&mdash;him mount and
ride up to de hofficer.  'Gentlemen, fall in&mdash;form
subdivisions&mdash;quick march'&mdash;rum, dum, dum, dum, again,
and away we march out to de <i>glacis</i> of de fort&mdash;den
we form, and much manoeuvre we was perform&mdash;oh
wery brilliant, 'wid cartridge, prime, and load.'  'De
regiment will fire by companies from right to
left'&mdash;short tap on de drum&mdash;de hofficer commanding companies
fall back two pace&mdash;ready, present, fire&mdash;blaze
go de grenadier&mdash;I prick my ear, and cock my eye.
Ogly Jack, my covering file, was not fire&mdash;I know,
because de moment I pull de trigger, I clap my right
cheek down on de barrel of de musket as he was level&mdash;all
cold iron&mdash;'Ha, ha,' say I to myself, and while
loading, I glance my eye at Yellow-skin Paul's
firelock, who was next me, and also at Mundingo Tom's,
who was next Jack, bote on dem were half cock.
So 'Ha, ha,' say me Quacco again, but before I could
determine in my own mind what I should do, de word
was given&mdash;'De regiment will fire one volley direct
to de front.&mdash;Ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire,'&mdash;roar went de
musketry&mdash;all smoke for small space&mdash;we remain at
de present&mdash;wait long time for de major give de word
'Come to de recover,'&mdash;no one speak&mdash;all of we
remain wid our piece level&mdash;oh! one attitude wery
tiresome.  Still no one speak.  At length I hear our
captain, one wery nice man, grumble to himself&mdash;'Why,
what can be amiss wid de old major?'&mdash;dat
moment de smoke, by de setting in of de sea-breeze,
was blow off.  What shall we see?&mdash;Why, Major
D&mdash;&mdash; was lying on him horse's neck, widin ten yard
of de grenadier company.  'Ah!' say for we captain&mdash;'he
must be in one fit'&mdash;when down de major drop&mdash;and
away scamper de horse&mdash;de captain run up,
and turn de old man on him back, and take off him
stock, and open him jacket.  'Ah!' cry he&mdash;'mutiny,
gentlemen, mutiny; de major is shot dead.
Secure de magazine; call out de artillery.'  Den one
loud buz buz pass along de line&mdash;de hofficer voice was
heard&mdash;'Men, if you move one step I will cut you
down by G&mdash;d.'  Anoder say&mdash;'Stand to your arms,
men; if one of you, stir, I will run him troo.'  'Who
is de willain?&mdash;who is de willain?' shout some one
else.  Someting come over me&mdash;I rush out five pace&mdash;order
my fusee, and touch my cap&mdash;wery graceful&mdash;so&mdash;[suiting
the action to the word]&mdash;'Captain, and
gentlemen&mdash;dere are de mutineers.'&mdash;'Where?'&mdash;'Dere.'&mdash;'Name
dem.' say one.&mdash;'I will,' say me
Quacco&mdash;'Ogly Jack, Mundingo Tom, and
Yellow-skin Paul.'  Dey were all immediately secure&mdash;and
marshed to de front;&mdash;dem say noting&mdash;-not one
word.  I look at dem&mdash;all tree cool and collected.
'May be,' tink I, 'dere will have be some mistake;
if so, all people will tink I mosh have been de
mutineer, murserer you call, and dat to shave myself I
was peach on dem.'  My heart sink when de agitant
seize me by de shoulder.  'My fine fellow, you make
mosh noise&mdash;we shall see what you are make of very
shortly yourself.&mdash;Here, secure Corporal Quacco.'  By
dis time we were again marching into de fort&mdash;de
gate was shut&mdash;four field piece nine pounder, manned
by white artillerymen, and load wid grape, were
pointed so as to enfilade us as we were formed in close
column, and my tree friend, and myself, were
instantly brought to one drum-head court-martial.&mdash;Some
young hofficer say, 'Oh, hang him all&mdash;hang
him all.'&mdash;'Please not, young gentleman, if de same
ting to you,' say I.&mdash;'No hurry,' say I&mdash;'I am
willing to be hang if dese tree willains are not de men.
Secure dem hands'&mdash;dis was done.  'Now,' say I,
'we were all sarve wid eight blank cartridge&mdash;look at
dem muskets&mdash;plain dey all have been fire.'&mdash;'What
has all dis to do wid it?' say de agitant.&mdash;'Mosh,'
say I, 'mosh&mdash;now see how many cartridge each on
dem hab.'&mdash;'Ha, ha,' say my captain,&mdash;'Quacco is
right.&mdash;<i>Dem all tree hub each de eight cartridge
untouch, yet it quite evident dey all hab fired</i>.'&mdash;'What
say you, ye scoundrels,' again say de captain&mdash;'what
say you why you should not be hang immediately?'
Dem would not speak one word&mdash;den I tell all I
hear&mdash;and so dem try, find guilty, and were hang&mdash;and I
as one reward got my discharge."  (Here our friend
made a long pause&mdash;at length he continued.)  "Why
I take him&mdash;I can't tell&mdash;and still more, why I leave
dear Jamaica, where de governor hoffer me ground to
grow nyam in, and house&mdash;and as for wife, I hab
several.  What de debil was possess me to leave my
pig, and wives, and allowance&mdash;pension you call
him,&mdash;and take into my head for come here again?&mdash;Heaven
know&mdash;I Quacco do not.&mdash;Here&mdash;where one can
scarcely breathe for stinking mud, and every night
brings dangers wid it, and you never can tell whidder
de next morning shall not see you carried away into
slavery, or may be sacrificed before one fetish; or
who know dat he shall not, some fine forenoon, be
roast or grill, and eaten like one monkey.  Oh, I
wish I was back again."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Sprawl, "you seem to have left off
as corporal&mdash;when became you serjeant?"
</p>

<p>
Quacco laughed, "By brevet, my good sir&mdash;by bre"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A gun&mdash;Sir Oliver speaking to us in the offing."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for Old Gazelle once more!" shouted
Sprawl, in a voice like thunder.
</p>

<p>
"Out of my way, friend Quacco," cried I.
</p>

<p>
"Room if you please, old Daddy Longyarn," quoth
master Lanyard.  And to the great dismay of poor
Quacco, who little expected to have been so suddenly
and unceremoniously swept aside, we all tumbled on
deck as fast as our legs could carry us.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
</h3>

<h4>
THE FETISH&mdash;CROSSING THE BAR, AND <br />
DESTRUCTION OF THE SLAVER.
</h4>

<p>
The first man we encountered was Clinker, the
master-at-arms.
</p>

<p>
"Who has seen the frigate?" said Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there she is, sir," replied the man.  "There,
you see her topgallant sails over the green bushes
there, sir.  Now you see the heads of her fore and
maintopsails."
</p>

<p>
"I see, I see.  What signal is that flying at the
fore, Mr Marline?" to the midshipman who was
looking out.
</p>

<p>
"The signal to close, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Close," croaked old Sprawl&mdash;"close&mdash;easier said
than done, Sir Oliver."
</p>

<p>
"Like the Starling, 'we can't get out,'" quoth I.
</p>

<p>
Here the frigate in the offing slowly and majestically
shoved her long jib-boom past the mangroves
on the westernmost bank, and gradually the whole
beautiful machine hove in sight, rising and falling on
the long swell.
</p>

<p>
As she came round the point, she took in topgallant
sails, and hauled down the foretopmast staysail;
and whenever she had fairly opened the river, and
come nearly abreast of us, she laid her maintopsail to
the mast, with her fore and mainsails hanging in
graceful festoons in the brails, and hove-to under her
three topsails, jib, and spanker.  She slid silently and
majestically along; the bright green wave curling
outwards from her beautifully moulded bows, like the
shell-shaped canopy of Daddy Neptune's car, as the
cut-water slid gently through the calm heaving of the
blue swell, and gradually subsiding, as the glorious old
hooker lost her way, and became stationary, when she
floated, like a swan asleep on the dark waters, the
bright sun shining cheerily on her white sails and
hammocks and clear white streak, and sparkling on
her glittering sides, as they rose and fell fresh and wet
from the embraces of old Ocean; and as the land-breeze
laid her over, her gold-bright copper blazed
like one vast polished mirror, wherein the burning
sun was reflected in dazzling glances.  Bright blinding
rays flashed out, starlike, from the window in the
quarter gallery, and the glass in the scuttles of the
officer's cabins, and from every burnished piece of
metal throughout the whole length of the gallant
craft, converting her black hull into a brilliant
constellation; while her heavy lower masts, with their
strong shrouds and stays, and the swelling sails, and
the tall and taper spars aloft, were seen clear and
distinct against the deep blue of the seaward horizon.
</p>

<p>
As we looked, the frigate hauled down the jib, and
brailed up the spanker.  A string of small round
bundles, apparently each about the size of a man's
head, now twisted and struggled, and stopped, and
finally slid up to the main royal-mast-head.  The
instant the uppermost reached the truck, as if it had
touched a spring&mdash;bang&mdash;a gun was fired, and at the
same moment the round balls blew out steadily in so
many flags.
</p>

<p>
"What signal now, Mr Marline?"
</p>

<p>
"The signal to weigh and stand out, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why, we can't; it is impossible: although the
wind is fair, the swell on the bar puts it out of our
power."
</p>

<p>
"Very true," said old Pumpbolt; "and you had
better say so, Lanyard.  I, for one, won't undertake
to carry you over until there is less broken water at
the river's mouth, I know."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant commanding the felucca telegraphed
to this effect; the frigate acknowledged it, and
answered, that she would remain in the offing all night
in expectation of our getting over at high water,
when possibly there would be less sea on the bar.
</p>

<p>
Having made this signal, she run her jib up, set
topgallant-sails, and let fall the foresail: the
ponderous mainyard slowly swung round, and as the noble
frigate fetched way again, she gradually fell off before
the wind; her long low hull fore-shortened into a mere
tub of a vessel to look at, and finally presenting her
stern to us, she lay over, inclining herself gracefully
to the breeze, as if she was bidding us farewell,
and glided cheerily away; indicating by the increasing
whiteness of her wake, the accelerated speed with
which she clove the heaving billows.
</p>

<p>
"There goes the dear old beauty," said Davie;
"there's a retiring curtsy for you that beats the
stateliest of my lady patronesses at Almacks."
</p>

<p>
Having gained an offing of about three miles, she
again shortened sail, and hove to in her station to
await our joining, when the bar became passable in
the night.
</p>

<p>
"Weary work, master Benjie,&mdash;weary work," said
Davie Doublepipe; "so here we must lie, roasting
another whole day, while there is plenty of water on
the bar, if that confounded swell would only fall."
</p>

<p>
By this it was drawing near the men's dinner-time;
and while the lieutenant and I were pacing the deck,
rather disconsolately, trying to steer clear of the smoke
of the galley, that streamed aft as we rode head to
wind, we noticed that our sable visitor, Serjeant
Quacco, had, with the true spirit of resignation,
declined into cook's mate (indeed, if there be a Negro
on board when this birth becomes vacant, he invariably
slides into it, as naturally as a snail into his shell),
and was busy in assisting the maimed seaman who was
watching the coppers.  The fire seemed to burn very
indifferently from the greenness of the wood, which
gave out more smoke than flame.
</p>

<p>
"Drainings, my man," said Lanyard to cookey,
"don't choke us, if you please.  Do get some dry
chips from Shavings, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," said the man.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Quacco, mind the fire," continued Drainings,
"till I get some splinters from forward
there.&mdash;Stay&mdash;Lennox, my dear boy, do get me a handful of
dry chips from old Shavings, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
The Scotch corporal civilly complied; and after a
little, we saw him split up a block of wood where the
carpenter had been at work in the bows of the felucca,
and presently he returned with a bundle of them,
which Serjeant Quacco busily employed himself in
poking into the fire, blowing lustily with his blubber
lips all the while.  When Lennox turned away, I
could not help noticing, that he stuck his tongue in
his cheek, and winked to one of the crew as he went
below.
</p>

<p>
Presently Lanyard desired the boatswain to pipe to
dinner.  In place of bundling down below, according
to the etiquette of the service in larger vessels, he
winked, I saw, at the poor fellows breaking away
forward into messes, which they contrived to screen from
the view of the quarterdeck, by slewing the long yard
nearly athwart ships, and loosing the sail as if to dry.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all this, we could easily see what
was going on forward.  Close to, sat the old cook
himself, with Shavings the carpenter, and Wadding
the gunner, warrant officers in a small way, with a
little snipe of a boy waiting on them.
</p>

<p>
About a fathom from them, there was another
group squatted on the deck, consisting of Corporal
Lennox, old Clinker the master at arms, Dogvane the
quartermaster, and no smaller a personage than
Serjeant Quacco.
</p>

<p>
The food was peas-soup, and salt junk and biscuit.
The hands, as we turned and returned, seemed exceedingly
comfortable and happy; when all at once, the
old cook pressed his hands on the pit of his stomach,
and began to make a variety of rather odd grimaces.
Dogvane looked in his face, and instantly seemed to
catch the infection; so he next began to screw
himself up into a variety of indescribable contortions.
Serjeant Quacco looked first at one, and then at
another, as they groaned in any thing but a melodious
concert, until he too, through sympathy, or in reality
from pain, began also to twist himself about, and to
make such hideous faces, that to have trusted him
near a respectable pig in the family way, would have
been as much as the nine farrow were worth.
</p>

<p>
At length the contagion became general apparently,
and Corporal Lennox began to groan and wince, as
he ejaculated, "Oh dear, what can this be! what an
awful pain in my stomach!  Why, Mr Drainings, what
<i>have</i> you clapt into that peas-soup?  <i>Something bye
common</i> you must have put into it, for we are all
dying here with"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My eye!" said old Drainings, speaking slowly
and deliberately, as if the paroxysm had subsided, and
some strange light had suddenly flashed on him, "you
are quite right, Lennox.  That same peas-soup is none
of the right sort&mdash;that is clear now.  I have just been
telling Mr Wadding that a wery-most-remarkable
circumstance took place in the boiling on't."
</p>

<p>
Here the old fellow, who had just finished his
peas-soup, very solemnly looked upwards, and wiped his
muzzle with what hovered between a pocket-handkerchief
and a dishclout, of any colour but that of
unsunned snow.
</p>

<p>
"Why," continued the cook, "just when it began
to simmer about the edges of the boiler&mdash;&mdash;Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;oh&mdash;there
it is again&mdash;there it is again," and once
more he began to tumble about on the deck, giving
friend Quacco several miscellaneous kicks and punches
during his make-believe involuntary convulsions.  This
fit seemed also to pass over.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said he, "just when the soup began to
simmer about the edges of the copper, and thin streaks
of white froth began to shoot inwards towards the
middle, where the hot soup was whirling round in a
bubbling eddy, and poppling up for all the world like
the sea on the bar there, I saw&mdash;I saw"&mdash;&mdash;Here he
looked unutterable things with his one eye, turning it
up like a duck in thunder.
</p>

<p>
"What did you see?" said old Clinker, staring in
his face with sham earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"I saw&mdash;so sure as I see Mr Weevil the purser's
d&mdash;d ugly mug aft on the quarterdeck there&mdash;a small
devil rise out of the boiling peas-soup in the very
middle of the copper, and fly up and away over the
truck like a shot&mdash;whipping the vane at the mast-head
off its spindle with the bight of his tail.
</p>

<p>
"No! did you though?" said several voices.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I did," rejoined Drainings, "as distinctly
as I now see my thumb&mdash;none of the cleanest,
by the way."
</p>

<p>
"The devil?" said Lennox, starting up; "what
was it like, Mr Drainings?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, as like the little heathen god brought on
board by Quacco there, as you can fancy any thing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh," again resounded from all hands.
</p>

<p>
"But it could not be he," at length struck in the
black serjeant.  "It could not be he, seeing he is safe
stow below de heel of de bowsprit dere."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven grant it may be so," whined Dogvane.
</p>

<p>
"If it really be as Quacco says," said Wadding, in
a sympathizing tone, "why, <i>then</i>, I will believe it is
all fancy&mdash;all a barn."
</p>

<p>
Here the black serjeant, in great tribulation, rose
to go forward, evidently with a desire to reconnoitre
whether the graven image was really there in the body
or no.  After a long search, he came back and sat
down, blank and stupified, on the spot where he had
risen from.
</p>

<p>
"And pray, Mr Drainings, when did you see this
curious appearance?" persisted Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"At the wery instant of time," drawled Cookey,
with his arms crossed, and his hands stuck into the
open bosom of his greasy shirt, that had once been
red flannel, and with a short black stump of a pipe in
his mouth, from which he puffed out a cloud between
every word, "at the wery instant of time, by the
glass, that Serjeant Quacco there mended the fire."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!"&mdash;Here all hands of the rogues
who were in the secret, began again to roll about and
grimace, as if a travelling <i>menagerie</i> of baboons had
suddenly burst, and capsized its inmates all about.
Quacco all this while was twisting and turning
himself, and, although evidently in a deuced quandary,
trying to laugh the affair off as a joke.
</p>

<p>
"Well," at length said he, "I don't believe in
fetish&mdash;now dat I is among whiteman Christian.  So
I will tank you, Massa Draining, to hand me over
my chocolate."
</p>

<p>
But I noticed that the devil a drop would he take
into his mouth, although he made believe to drink it.
The jest went on&mdash;at length there was a calm, when
who should again break ground but Serjeant Quacco&mdash;who
made a last attempt to laugh off the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
"But where de debil <i>can</i> he be?" said he, almost
involuntarily&mdash;"gone, sure enough."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;" sung out all hands once more,
with their fists stuck into their midriffs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that vile fetish," screamed Lennox; "we
must all be bewitched&mdash;Quacco, we are all bewitched.'"
</p>

<p>
"Bewitch!" responded the black Serjeant, jumping
off the deck, and now at his wit's end; "and I
believe it is so.  I hab pain in my tomak too&mdash;just
dis moment&mdash;oh, wery sharp!"
</p>

<p>
"Confound your fetish," groaned the old cook;
"it was just as you stuck those chips of cedarwood
into the fire&mdash;precisely at the wery moment I snuffed
the delicious smell of them, that I saw the devil
himself first put his ugly fiz up in the middle of the
peas-soup, and gibber, and twinkle his eyes, and say"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Say!" shouted Lennox&mdash;"why did he really and
truly speak, Mr Drainings?"
</p>

<p>
"Speak!" responded he of the slush bucket&mdash;"speak! ay,
as plain as I do now."
</p>

<p>
"And what said he?" quoth Dogvane.
</p>

<p>
"Why, just as he shook off the spray from the
barb at the end of his tail, says he,&mdash;'Damme, I'm off,'
says he."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh, oh!  I am pinned through my ground
tier with a harpoon," groaned Drainings.
</p>

<p>
"Where, in the devil's name, since we have seen
him, got you those cedar chips, Quacco?" yelled old
Clinker.
</p>

<p>
A light seemed to break in on the poor Serjeant's
bewildered mind.  "Chip, chip!&mdash;where I get dem
chip?"  Here the poor fellow gave an idiotic laugh,
as if he had been all abroad.  "I get dem from
Corporal Lennox, to be sure,"&mdash;and he turned his eyes
with the most intense earnestness towards the marine,
who was rolling about the deck over and over.
</p>

<p>
"Where got I the chips, did you ask, Quacco?
Oh, oh, oh!&mdash;Why, Heaven forgive me&mdash;but I am
punished for it now&mdash;they are the very splinters of
your fetish, that you brought on board!"
</p>

<p>
Up started the black resetter as if bit by a
rattlesnake, dancing and jumping, "Oh, my tomack, oh,
my tomack!&mdash;de fetish have get into my tomack&mdash;de
leetle debil in a my tomack.  Oh, doctor, doctor!&mdash;one
evil spirit in me&mdash;oh, doctor, someting to
make him fly&mdash;someting to get him out!  Doctor,
de debil in a my belly&mdash;physic&mdash;physic, doctor;
de strongerer de more betterer.  Oh Lord!"  And
away he tumbled down the fore-hatchway, roaring
for Esculapius like a perfect bull of Bashan.
</p>

<p>
While we were laughing at this to our heart's
content, Mr Marline came aft to us.  "There are a good
many dark specks passing and repassing above us in
the furthermost reach of the river, yonder, sir&mdash;as far
as you can see there, sir.  Will you please to look at
them, Mr Sprawl?"
</p>

<p>
Sprawl took a long squint first, and then handed
the glass to me.  I peered, and peered.  The glorious
stream was rolling down like a shining flow of
quicksilver; but although all continued quiet in our
vicinity, yet, where it narrowed nearly to a bright point
in the distance above, I could perceive a tiny dark
object slowly descend the river, and send up a thick
cloud of smoke, after which it remained stationary,
while a number of small black spots were seen
cruising hither and thither all around it.
</p>

<p>
Sprawl had also noticed this.  "Why, Brail, those
gentry seem mustering in some strength.  There
cannot be many fewer than a hundred canoes paddling
about there.  What say you?"
</p>

<p>
It was now near three, P.M., and we were bethinking
ourselves of going to dinner, when a perfect cloud
of the dark specks, fifty at the least, began to drop
down with the ebb in a solid phalanx, looking in
the distance like a compact black raft of wood.
Presently they sheered off right and left; and although
the craft from which we had seen the smoke arise,
still remained at anchor in the stream, the attendant
canoes vanished, one and all, amongst the mangroves,
on either bank.  "Poo&mdash;nonsense!" said Dick
Lanyard.  "Come along, Sprawl&mdash;come along.  Why,
man, we shall get as thin as whipping-posts, if we
allow these barbarian demonstrations to interfere
with our comforts."
</p>

<p>
"You may be right, my boy&mdash;you may be right,"
said old Davie; but he appeared to have some strange
misgivings.
</p>

<p>
However, we went to dinner; the reefers were all
with us, little Joe Peake among the rest, who was
now quite recovered from the thump he had got on
shore, and old Pumpbolt; and we were in the very
middle of it, when down came Wadding, the gunner.&mdash;"Beg
pardon, sir," said the old seaman, sidling in,
and trying to appear at his ease, although he was very
far from that same.  "Beg pardon&mdash;but them chaps
are coming more nearer, sir, than seems quite
convenient,&mdash;they are fast dropping down with the
afternoon's ebb, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said old Sprawl, "We must keep a
bright look-out here, Brail, at any rate."
</p>

<p>
We went on deck, and the report was literally true;
but although the mass above us continued to increase
until the whole surface of the river in the distance
seemed swarming, as one has seen a pool with those
blue water-insects which, I believe, as boys, we used
to call sailors, still there was no warlike demonstration
made, beyond the occasional descent of a fast-pulling
canoe now and then, a mile or so below the
main body.  But they were always very easily
satisfied in their reconnoitring, so far as we could judge,
for the whole of them kept a wary distance.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the cabin for half an hour, and having
finished off with a caulker of good cogniac, all
hands of us once more came on deck.
</p>

<p>
It was now half-past four, and low water as near
as could be.  The bar astern of us&mdash;by this time the
breeze having taken off, we were riding to the
ebb&mdash;was one roaring ledge of white breakers; but it was
smooth water where we lay, the fall of the tide
having completely broken the heave of the heavy swell
that rolled in from the offing on the bar.  The clouds
had risen over the land, some large drops of rain fell,
and altogether we had strong prognostications of a
wet, if not a tempestuous evening.
</p>

<p>
The declining sun, however, was yet shining
brightly; and although, calculating on the average at
this season hereabouts, one might have made himself
almost sure of a fine evening, yet the present was an
exception, and we had every appearance of a thunderstorm.
</p>

<p>
All nature seemed hushed; the thick clouds that
arose in the east, sailed along on the usual current of
the trade-wind with their edges as well defined as if
it had been a dark screen gradually shoving up and
across the arch of the blue empyrean; this gloomy
canopy crept on and on, and as it overlapped us and
stole down the western horizon, every thing assumed
a deep dusky purple hue.
</p>

<p>
In the sudden darkness, the fires glanced bright
and red on board of three war-canoes, that had now
been suddenly advanced down the river in the shape
of a triangle, the headmost being within a mile of us.
Presently, the sable curtain descended within a very
few degrees of the western horizon, until there was
only a small streak of bright golden sky between it
and the line of the land; in the centre of which the
glorious sun, now near his setting, shot his level beams
of blood-red light over the river and its banks, and
the trees that grew on them, gilding the dark sides
of the canoes; and as he sank, his last rays flashed
up into the black arch overhead, until the dark
masses of cloud glowed like crimson.
</p>

<p>
This soon faded&mdash;the clouds gradually sinking in
the west, until, as if their scope had been expended,
they <i>lifted</i> from the eastern horizon majestically
slow&mdash;like a magnificent curtain drawn up in order to
disclose the glorious moon, which now, preceded by her
gemlike forerunner the evening star, that sparkled
bright and clear on the fringe of the ascending cloud,
rose above the low swampy banks, like a diamond on
the skirt of a sable velvet mantle.
</p>

<p>
Her disk, when she first appeared, was red and dim,
until she attained a considerable altitude, when,
having struggled through the pestilential effluvia that
hovered over the river, she began to sail through her
liquid track in all her splendour&mdash;pale, but oh, how
crystal clear!&mdash;driving, like a queen, the dark vapours
before her.
</p>

<p>
As the night wore on, the congregation of canoes
became thicker, and presently something like a raft
floated down to within three quarters of a mile of us,
accompanied by five large boats, full of people.
</p>

<p>
It was clearly distinguishable, from a bright halo
of luminous smoke that hovered over it, proceeding
from a fire that every now and then blazed up on
board.  By the time the raft was anchored, the
evening breeze came strong down the river, wafting
towards us the sounds of African drums, blended with
dismal yells, as of captives, and loud fierce shouts.
</p>

<p>
I directed my glass towards the name, that was
flashing fitfully, as if tar or rosin, or some other equally
inflammable substance, had been suddenly cast into it.
</p>

<p>
"What can that be?" said I, to young De Walden,
who was also spying away at the same object, close to
where I stood.
</p>

<p>
"Really," said the very handsome boy, "I cannot
well tell, but I will call Serjeant Quacco, sir.  He
knows all the practices of the savages hereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," rejoined I; "never mind&mdash;never mind;
but what <i>can</i> they be doing there on the raft?  I see
two uprights about five feet asunder, and judging from
the dusky figures that are cruising about them, and
the fire that is kindled beneath, as it were between
them, they should be about eight feet high above the
raft on which they are rigged.  What <i>are</i> they after
now?  Two fellows sitting on men's shoulders, are
fixing a cross piece, or transom, on the top of the
uprights&mdash;now they are lashing it to them tightly with
some sort of rope&mdash;ah, they descend, and the fire
seems to have gone out, for every thing is dark again."
</p>

<p>
All in the neighbourhood of the raft was now
undistinguishable, but small red fires began to burn
steadily in the three advanced canoes.
</p>

<p>
"What next?" said Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I suppose, having set their piquets for the
night, we are safe."  And I took the glass from my
eye, and banged the joints of it one into another, when
De Walden spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Please look again, sir&mdash;please look again."  I did
so.  The gibbet sort of erection that I had been
inspecting, was now lit up by a sudden glare of bright
crimson flame.  The dark figures, and the bows and
sides of the attendant canoes, and the beams of the
gallows-looking machine itself, were all tinged with a
blood-red light, and presently the sound of the Eboe
drums and flutes was borne down on the night-wind
with startling distinctness, and louder than before,
drowning the snoring of the toads, and <i>chir-chir-chirring</i>,
and <i>wheetle-wheetling</i> of the numberless noisy
insects that floated off from the bank on either side
of us.
</p>

<p>
"What is that&mdash;do you see that, Master de Walden?"
said I, as a dark struggling figure seemed to
be transferred by force from one of the canoes that
showed a light into a smaller one.  De Walden could
not tell&mdash;and the small skiff into which, whatever it
was, it had been transhipped, gradually slid away,
apparently in the direction of the raft, into the
impervious darkness that brooded over the river, above the
three advanced canoes with the watch-fires.
</p>

<p>
I was about resigning the glass once more, when I
noticed the raft again suddenly illuminated, and a
great bustle among the people on board.  Presently a
naked human being was dragged under the gallows,
and one arm immediately hoisted up, and fastened by
cords to one of the angles&mdash;a black figure, who had
perched himself astride on the cross beam, evincing
great activity on the occasion.
</p>

<p>
For some purpose that I could not divine, the fire
was now carried by a group of savages from the foremost
part of the raft, that is, from the end of it next
us, to the opposite extremity beyond the gibbet, the
immediate effect of which was to throw off the latter,
and the figure suspended on it, as well as the persons
of the people who crowded round, in high relief against
the illuminated night damps lit up by the fire, that
hung as a bright curtain or background beyond it.  In
a few seconds, the other arm was drawn up to the
opposite corner: and&mdash;my blood curdles as I write
it&mdash;we could now make out that a fellow-creature was
suspended by the wrists from the corners of the
gibbet, directly under the centre of the beam, as if the
sufferer had been stretched on the cross.
</p>

<p>
The fire increased in intenseness&mdash;the noise of the
long drums, and the yells of the negroes, came down
stronger and stronger; and although I could notice
two assistants holding the legs of the suspended figure,
yet its struggles seemed to be superhuman, and once
or twice I said to young De Walden, "Heaven help
me&mdash;did you hear nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing particular, sir, beyond the infernal
howling and drum-beating of these monsters."
</p>

<p>
A pause&mdash;then another terrible convulsion of the
suspended victim, as it struggled to and fro with the
dark figures that clung to its lower limbs like demons.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;heard you nothing now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;oh, yes," gasped my young ally&mdash;"such
a yell!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, may my ears never tingle to such another!"
groaned I; and as I spoke, the assistants let go their
hold on the suspended victim, when&mdash;Heaven have
mercy on us! horror on horror&mdash;one of the lower
limbs had been extracted, or cut out from the socket
at the hip joint.  The struggles of the mutilated
carcass continued.  Quacco, hearing his name mentioned
by the young midshipman, was now alongside of me.
I handed him the glass, which it was some time before
he could manage.  At length, having got the focus,
he took a long, long look&mdash;he held his breath.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" said I, "what dreadful scene is
this?  For Heaven's sake, serjeant, tell me what is
going on yonder?"
</p>

<p>
He puffed out his breath like a porpoise, and then
answered me as coolly as possible, as if it had been no
strange sight to him.  "Fetish, massa&mdash;grand fetish
dem make&mdash;such fetish as dem make before dem go
fight wid one enemy."
</p>

<p>
"But what was the figure we saw hoisted up on
the gibbet-looking apparatus just now?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Can't tell," rejoined Quacco, "can't really tell,
massa; at first I taught it was man&mdash;but dat cry&mdash;so
wery bitter and sharp like one knife&mdash;no, I tink it
must have been woman."
</p>

<p>
"Almighty powers!  Do you mean to say that the
figure hung up between us and the fire is really and
truly a human being?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Serjeant Quacco, with the same <i>sang
froid</i>; "I do, massa.  What you tink it was?"
</p>

<p>
I could not tell&mdash;I thought at one moment it was a
fellow-creature, and at another that it must be
impossible, notwithstanding all the hideous tales I had
heard of the doings on this coast; but the truth, the
horrible truth could no longer be concealed.
</p>

<p>
"It is only one man or woman prisoner dat dem
are cutting in pieces, and trowing into de river."  Here
I saw with my glass that the other leg of the victim
had been severed from the trunk.  "But I sall tell
you, dat dem intend to attack you dis wery night."
</p>

<p>
I heard him, but was riveted to my telescope.  All
struggles had ceased in the dark and maimed carcass,
and presently one of the arms was cut away at the
shoulder, when the bloody limb fell against the post
on one side, and the mangled trunk banged against
the upright on the other, and swung round and round
it, making the whole engine reel; while, as the drums
and shouts grew louder and louder, the other arm was
also cut off at the elbow, and down came the mutilated
trunk of the sacrifice into the middle of the fire,
which for a moment blazed up, and shot forth showers
of sparks and bright smoke, then rapidly declined, and
in half a minute it was entirely extinguished.
</p>

<p>
The fires in the advanced boats were now all put
out, and nothing evinced the neighbourhood of our
dangerous enemy; while the lovely moon once more
looked forth on us, her silver orb reflected on the
arrowy streams of the dark river, in a long trembling
wake of sparkling ripples, and all was as quiet as if she
had been smiling on a scene of peace and gentleness.
</p>

<p>
To what peculiarity in my moral composition it
was to be attributed I do not know, but the change
from the infernal scene we had just witnessed to the
heavenly quietude of a lovely night had an instantaneous,
almost an electrical effect on me; and, wounded
and ill at heart as I was, I could not help looking
up, out and away from my grovelling condition, until
in fancy I forgot my miserable whereabouts, and only
saw the deep blue heaven, and its countless stars, and
the chaste moon.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Benjie Brail," shouted friend Davie&mdash;"where
away, my lad?  Come back to mother earth"&mdash;("<i>alma
mater tellus</i>," said a voice near me&mdash;Corporal
Lennox for a thousand, thought I)&mdash;"my dear
boy, the bright sky overhead, that <i>I</i> make no doubt you
are apostrophising so poetically, will soon be shrouded
by that brooding mist there&mdash;never doubt me."
</p>

<p>
He augured rightly; for, in a little, a thick haze
did in very deed begin to mantle over the water, and
continued to increase until the glorious planet and
bright stars were again obscured, and you could
scarcely see the length of the felucca.
</p>

<p>
Quacco's hint, however, was by no means thrown
away on us; we immediately saw all clear to give our
savage neighbours a warm reception, should they
venture down under cover of the fog.
</p>

<p>
We had been some time at quarters, the boats astern
having been hauled up alongside, lest, in the fog, some
of the canoes might venture near enough to cut
the painters.  But every thing continued so quiet and
still, that we were beginning to consider our warlike
preparations might not altogether have teen called for.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Sprawl," said I&mdash;"Poo, these poor creatures
will not venture down on us; especially after
the lesson they had yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't trust to that, Brail, my good boy," said
Davie.
</p>

<p>
"No, massa, don't you trust to dat, as Massa Prawl
say," quoth Quacco&mdash;"I know someting&mdash;ah, you
shall see."  Here the poor fellow crept close up to
Dick Lanyard, "Captain&mdash;if you love sleep in one
skin hab no hole in him&mdash;if, massa, you walue de life
of dem sailor intrust to you&mdash;ill-bred fellow as dem
may be,&mdash;let no one&mdash;no&mdash;not so mosh as de leetle
dirty cook-boy&mdash;shut him eyelid until to-morrow sun
melt de fog, and"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Something dropped at my foot, with a splintering
sort of sound, as if you had cast a long dry reed on
the deck.  "What is that?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Will you be convince now?" said Quacco, slowly
and solemnly.  "Will Massa Brail,"&mdash;turning to me,
and handing a slender wand, about ten feet
long,&mdash;"will good Massa Brail be convin"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Spin&mdash;another arrow-like affair quivered in the mast
close beside us.  It had passed sheer between the first
lieutenant and me.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, ah, ah!" exclaimed Quacco in a mighty
great quandary&mdash;"dere is anoder&mdash;anoder spear&mdash;mind,
gentlemen&mdash;mind, gentlemen, mind, or a whole
feet of war-canoe will be aboard of you before you can
look round."
</p>

<p>
"Men!" shouted Lanyard, "keep a bright lookout;
there are native canoes cruising all about us,
and close to, in the thick mist there.  Peer about,
will ye?  Small-arm men, stand to your
tackling&mdash;clear away both guns.  Hush&mdash;what is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Sprawl&mdash;"I hear nothing but the
rushing of the river, and the groaning and rubbing of
the boats alongside against the gunwale."
</p>

<p>
"But I do," said Pumpbolt.
</p>

<p>
"And so do I," said Mr Marline.  "There is the
splash of paddles as plain as can be&mdash;there"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said De Walden.
</p>

<p>
"There," said Binnacle&mdash;"there;" and, at the
very instant, I saw the dark prow of one canoe emerge
from the fog, the after-part being hid under the thick,
but moon-illumined haze.  Presently another appeared
close to her, but less distinctly; both assuming a
wavering and impalpable appearance, like two large
fish seen, one near, and the other farther off, in
muddy water.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Marline, fire at that fellow nearest us."
</p>

<p>
The moment the musket was discharged, the canoe
backed into the fog again, but we could plainly hear
the splash and whiz of a number of paddles rapidly
plied, as if in great alarm.  But even these sounds
soon ceased, and, once more, all was still.  For half
an hour after this, all hands remained on the <i>qui
vive</i>, but the silence continued unbroken; so, after
seeing the lookouts all right, Sprawl, Pumpbolt, and
myself (as for Lanyard he would not leave the deck)
went below to have a snack of supper, preparatory to
making a start of it, if it were possible, whenever the
swell on the bar was quieter.
</p>

<p>
"Tol lol de rol," sung <i>ould</i> Davie Doublepipe.
"Oh Benjie Brail, Benjie Brail, are we never to get
out of this Styx&mdash;out of this infernal river?  What
say you, Pumpbolt, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you more about it," said Pumpbolt,
"when we have got some grub.  But <i>what</i> Sir Oliver
has done, or how he has managed without <i>me</i>, for
these two days past, <i>is</i> a puzzler."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, bad for you master," said I.  "He will find
he can do without you&mdash;should not have given him
the opportunity, man."
</p>

<p>
"No more I should&mdash;no more I should," responded
the master.
</p>

<p>
So we set to our meal, and were making ourselves
as comfortable as circumstances admitted, when
Binnacle trundled down the ladder in red-hot haste.
</p>

<p>
"The canoes are abroad again, sir,&mdash;we hear them
close to, but the fog is thicker than ever."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" said I; and we all hurried on deck.
</p>

<p>
Imminent peril is a beautiful antisoporitic, and we
found all hands at quarters of their own accord&mdash;the
devil a drum need to have been beaten.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you hear them&mdash;where is the noise
you speak of?" said Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir," said one man&mdash;"Here, sir," said
another&mdash;and "Here," exclaimed a third, all indicating
different points of the compass.
</p>

<p>
It was clear our enemies were clustering round us
in force, although the fog was absolutely impervious
at a distance of ten paces.
</p>

<p>
"I say, master," said Sprawl, "the bar should almost
be passable now for a light craft like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Pumpbolt, "I make no doubt
but it is; and if this cursed mist would only clear
away, I would undertake to take the Midge, were
she twenty tons bigger, slap across it, and pledge my
credit she should clear it as sound as a bell; for we
have a noble moon, and Brail there is quite confident
about the river; besides, I took the bearings of the
westernmost channel with the eastern point this very
morning.  No fear, if it would <i>but</i> clear.  See if the
moonshine has not made the fog quite gauzelike, as
if it were bright and luminous of itself&mdash;Oh that it
would rise!"
</p>

<p>
The four little reefers were at this moment
clustered forward, close to me; we were riding with our
head up the river, and I saw one or two old hands
alongside of them, all looking out, and stretching
their necks and straining their eyes in a vain attempt
to pierce the fog.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?"&mdash;It was a greasy cheep, and
then a rattle, as if a loose purchase or fall had
suddenly been shaken, so as to make the blocks clatter,
and then hauled taught, as if people were having a
pull at the boom-sheet of a schooner, or other
fore-and-aft rigged vessel.
</p>

<p>
"What is that, indeed?" said Sprawl.  "Why,
look there&mdash;look there, Lanyard&mdash;see you nothing
there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I see nothing&mdash;eh&mdash;faith, but I do&mdash;why,
what is that?&mdash;Stand by, small-arm, men&mdash;go to
quarters the rest of ye&mdash;quick&mdash;Poo, it is simply a
thicker wreath of mist, after all."
</p>

<p>
Pumpbolt was standing by, but the object that we
thought we had seen descending the river was no
longer visible, and I began to think it was fancy.
Suddenly the mist thinned.
</p>

<p>
"There is the spectre-like object once more," I
shouted.  "By all that is portentous, it is a large
schooner, one of these slaving villains, who thinks he
can steal past us under cover of the mist&mdash;There&mdash;there
he is on our quarter&mdash;there are his royal and
gaff topsail over the thickest of the fog&mdash;now his
jib is stealing out of it."
</p>

<p>
"Clear away both guns there," sung out the fourth
lieutenant.  "We shall give him a rally as he passes,
if he won't speak."
</p>

<p>
The strange sail continued to slide noiselessly down
the river.
</p>

<p>
"What vessel is that?"&mdash;No answer&mdash;"Speak,
or I will fire into you."&mdash;All silent&mdash;"Take good
aim, men&mdash;fire!"
</p>

<p>
Both cannon were discharged, and, as if by magic,
the watery veil that had hid every thing from our
view rose from the bosom of the midnight river, and
hung above our mast-head in a luminous fleecy cloud,
which the moonbeams impregnated, but did not pierce,
being diffused by it over the whole scene below in a
mild radiance, like that cast by the ground glass globe
of a sinumbra lamp,&mdash;and disclosing suddenly the dark
stream above and on each side of us, covered with
canoes within pistol-shot; while the large schooner
that we had fired into, instead of making demonstrations
to escape over the bar, now shortened sail, and
bore up resolutely across our bows, firing two guns
and a volley of small arms into us in passing.
</p>

<p>
"We are beset, Lanyard&mdash;that chap is the
commander-in-chief.  His object is not to escape, but to
capture us, my lad&mdash;take my word for it," cried
Sprawl.  "Forward, master, and look out for the
channel&mdash;Lanyard, I recommend you to let Brail
take the helm&mdash;I will mind the sails."
</p>

<p>
"True enough, by Jupiter," sung out old Dick.
"Knock off from the guns, men&mdash;Shavings, stand by
to cut the cable&mdash;hoist away the sail there&mdash;cant her
with her head to the eastward&mdash;steady, men, and no
rushing now.  All ready there forward?"
</p>

<p>
"All ready, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Cut away, then."
</p>

<p>
The clear axe glanced bright and blue in the moonlight,
and fell twice in heavy gashing thumps, and the
third time in a sharp trenchant <i>chip</i>.  The next moment
the rushing of the rapid stream past our sides ceased,
as the little vessel slowly floated away, attaining
gradually the velocity of the river in which she swam.
Presently round she came.
</p>

<p>
"Hoist away, foresail and mainsail&mdash;hoist&mdash;haul
aft the sheets."
</p>

<p>
The breeze freshened at the moment.  We were
still about a mile from the bar, on which the swell
was breaking in thunder; but we had run clear of the
skirts of the mist, and the placid moon was again
shining crystal bright overhead.  The yells from the
canoes increased.  A volley of spears were lanced at
us, several of which fell on board, but none of them
did any injury; and several muskets were also fired
from the tiny men-of-war, which were equally
innocuous.  The strange sail was right in our path.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" sung out old Pumpbolt from
forward.
</p>

<p>
Trusting to the great strength of the Midge,
Lanyard shouted,&mdash;"Plump us right aboard of him, if
you can't do better; but creep under his stern, if
you can.  So starboard, Brail&mdash;starboard&mdash;steady&mdash;that
will do."
</p>

<p>
"Steady," I replied; but he would not give us the
opportunity, for as he saw us booming along,
apparently aiming at him right amidships, as if we had
thought we could have sawn him in two, the youth
bore up, and stood right for the bar.
</p>

<p>
"So, so," quoth Davie Doublepipe&mdash;"we are away
on a party of pleasure together, I perceive, señor?"
</p>

<p>
We carried on, but the Don, from superior sailing,
kept well on our bow; and we were now, as we could
judge from the increasing roar of the breakers,
rapidly approaching the river's mouth.
</p>

<p>
At this time we had a distinct view, not only of
our formidable antagonist, a large topsail schooner,
and apparently full of men, but of the bar which
we were about to pass, in such uncomfortable fellowship.
</p>

<p>
The canal of deep water that our steady and most
excellent master aimed at, was about fifty yards wide.
In it there was depth enough to allow the swell from
without to roll in, clear and unbroken, had it not been
met by the downward current of the river, aided, as
in the present case, by the land-breeze, which made
it break in short foam-crested waves.
</p>

<p>
We carried on.  All firing for the moment was out
of our craniums on either side.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see your marks now, Mr Brail&mdash;there in
the clear?" cried the master.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have the two trees on with the hummock&mdash;we
are running straight as an arrow for the channel."
</p>

<p>
"Steady then," sung out the old master.
</p>

<p>
"Steady," I returned once more.
</p>

<p>
On the right hand and on the left the swell was
by this time breaking in thunder, flashing up in
snowflakes, and sending up a misty drizzle into the cold
moonlight sky; but the channel right a-head was still
comparatively quiet.
</p>

<p>
The schooner made an attempt to luff across our bows.
</p>

<p>
"Aim at him again," sung out old Bloody Politeful.
"Aim at him again, Lanyard; to heave-to here
is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"Boarders, stand by," cried Lanyard; but he once
more, as we approached him, kept away.
</p>

<p>
We were now actually on the bar.  The noise was
astounding&mdash;deafening.  The sea foamed and raged,
and flew up in mist, and boiled in over our decks on
either hand, as if we had been borne away in some
phantom ship, that floated on white foam instead of
water; while, in the very channel we were running
through, the heave of the sea from without was met
by the rush of the stream downwards, and flashed up
in numberless jets of sparkling water, which danced
about in the moonlight, and curled, and hissed, and
vanished, as if they had been white-shrouded, unreal
midnight spectres.  We ran on, the strange sail on
our lee-beam.
</p>

<p>
"Now is your chance," shouted old Pumpbolt;
"jam him down against the long reef there&mdash;up with
your helm, Mr Brail."
</p>

<p>
"Ease off the sheets," chimed in the first lieutenant.
"Handsomely, men&mdash;handsomely."
</p>

<p>
In an instant our broadsides were rasping.
</p>

<p>
"Starboard&mdash;shove him down, Mr Brail!" again
shrieked the master; "hard-a-weather&mdash;keep her
away, and ram him on the reef there, or let us board
him&mdash;time enough to luff when he strikes."
</p>

<p>
I was fully alive to all this.  The whole scene was
now brightly lit up by the glorious moon, and we
could perfectly see what we were about.  We sheered
close aboard of the schooner.
</p>

<p>
"Fire, small-arm men&mdash;boarders, be ready."
</p>

<p>
He still eschewed the combat, however, and kept off
the wind also.  A bright rainbow was at this moment
formed by the moonbeams in the salt spray&mdash;the
blessed emblem of peace and forgiveness&mdash;<i>here!</i>
thought I, even in that overwhelming moment.  Yes;
the bow of the Immutable, of Him who hath said,
"My ways are not like your ways!" spanned the
elemental turmoil, the scene of the yet more fearful
conflict of man's evil passions, in a resplendent arch,
through which the stars sparkled, their bright rays
partaking of the hues through which they shone.
Oh, it was like the hope of mercy breaking through,
the gloom, and sanctifying, if it could not still, the
troubled heavings of a sinner's deathbed!
</p>

<p>
"A good omen&mdash;a glorious omen!" shouted young
de Walden in the excitement of the moment.
</p>

<p>
"Jam her on the reef!" again yelled the master.
</p>

<p>
I did so.  Crash&mdash;the schooner struck.  Her foremast
bent forward like a willow wand, the cordage and
blocks rattling, and then went over the bows like a shot.
The next sea broke over her in smoke, and hove her
broadside on upon the reef&mdash;another shock, and the
mainmast was lumbering and rasping over the sides.
She now fell off with her broadside to the sea, which
was making a fair breach over her; and while the
cries of the unfortunates aboard of her rent the air,
and it was clear she must instantly go to pieces, we
all at once slid out of the infernal turmoil of dashing
waves&mdash;"the hell of waters"&mdash;and rose buoyantly on
the long smooth swell, that was rolling in from the
offing.  For a minute before not a word had been
spoken by officers or men, all hands being riveted to
the deck, looking out, and expecting every instant
to see the vessel under foot driven into staves; but
now, as each man drew a long breath, old Davie, with
most unlooked-for agility, gave a <i>spang</i> into the air;
and while he <i>skiffed</i> his old hat over the mast-head, as
an offering to Neptune, the gallant little Midge bent to
the freshening blast, like a racehorse laying himself
to his work, and once more bounded exultingly "o'er
the glad waters of the dark blue sea," as if the sweet
little craft had been instinct with life, and conscious
that she had once more regained her own proper
element&mdash;the cloven water roaring at her bows, as the
stem tore through it, like a trenchant ploughshare;
and dashing it right and left into smoke, until it rushed
past us in a white sheet of buzzing water, that spun
away in a long straight wake astern; in the small
yeasty <i>swirls</i> of which the moon and stars sparkled
diamond-like, but of many hues, as if the surface of
the ever-restless ocean had been covered with floating
prisms.&mdash;"Hurrah&mdash;hurrah&mdash;we are once more in
blue water!"[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]

[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>]Some weeks after the preceding chapters appeared in Blackwood,
the following accounts of poor Lander's untimely fate reached
England&mdash;melancholy vouchers for the truth of the descriptions
contained in them:&mdash;

<p class="t3">
MURDER OF RICHARD LANDER.
</p>

<p class="t3">
(<i>Official Despatch.</i>)
</p>

<p>
"SIR,&mdash;Admiral Warren having mentioned to me your wish,
that any intelligence respecting the expedition on this coast might
be addressed to you privately, I take the advantage of this
communication to state, that on my arrival here this day from the
Cape and Sierra Leone, I found Mr Lander had died on the 2d
instant of a wound in the thigh.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Lander left here some time since for Cape Coast Castle,
to procure boats, &amp;c.; and having got one boat and two canoes,
manned by four Englishmen, seventeen black men, and two boys,
had proceeded up the Niger nearly to the town of Hiammock
(about 100 miles).  Confident of the friendship of the natives,
he was tracking the boat along there near the turn of the river,
and abreast of the island, which much narrowed the passage, when,
at 2 P.M., on the 20th ultimo, the boat grounding, a heavy fire
was opened from the bush on both sides, and from the island,
which killed two men, and wounded himself with three others.
A number of large armed canoes coming round the point at the
same time, they were obliged to abandon the boat, take to the
canoes, and make a running fight for four hours, in which they
lost another Englishman, killed, and four blacks wounded&mdash;making
a total of three killed, and eight wounded.
</p>

<p>
"He got to the Craven cutter, waiting at the mouth of the
river, late in the afternoon of the 21st, arrived here on the 25th,
and died on the 2d of this month.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Lander estimated the parties that attacked him at from
eight to ten thousand, all armed with swords or muskets&mdash;a
number, no doubt, much exaggerated&mdash;and felt convinced, from the
judicious position they occupied, that some Europeans were
assisting, which, from the slavers being much opposed to the English,
and any trade on the coast, is very probable.
</p>

<p>
"A Mrs Brown (wife of an English merchant up the river),
with her child, passengers, and a wounded black boy, were
unavoidably left in the boat when she was abandoned; but Mr
Lander communicated with King Boy, who immediately sent about
them, and had great hopes they would be returned uninjured.
The loss to the company in arms, goods, &amp;c. on the occasion is
stated to be about L.450.
</p>

<p>
"I trust I have not troubled you with unnecessary details, and
beg to remain, sir, your most obedient and humble servant,

ANOTHER ACCOUNT.
</p>

<p>
The following is an extract of a letter from the agent to Lloyd's
at Fernando Po, dated February 6, 1834:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will be sorry to be informed of the death of Richard
Lander, who left this place some weeks since in the Craven
cutter, belonging to the company, taking with him a long-boat I let
him have for the purpose.  On his arrival at the Nunn, he left
the cutter, and proceeded up the river in the boat with L.400
worth of goods, to join the iron steam-boat, which he had sent up
a few weeks before.  She was to proceed about 300 miles to a small
island, which he had purchased from the king, and where he had
a factory.  They had proceeded about 100 miles up, the current
being strong against them.  They were in good spirits, tracking
the boat along shore, when they were fired on from the bush.
Three men were killed, and four wounded: Mr Lander was of
the latter.  They had a canoe of their own, and at the time they
were fired on, the boat was aground; and to save themselves, they
were forced to leap into the canoe, and make the best of their way.
They were immediately followed by five or six war-canoes full of
men, keeping up a continued fire for five hours, until it got dark,
when they lost sight of them.  They arrived here on the 27th
ultimo.  Mr Lander expired this morning.  He wrote me a
letter two days ago, requesting that I would take charge of the
vessels and property of the African Inland Commercial Company,
with which I accordingly complied.  The ball entered near his
hip, and worked down to the thick of the thigh.  It was a
most malicious and treacherous attack.  Mr Lander told me that
there were Bonny, Brass, and Benin canoes; so that, from these
circumstances, I am of opinion that some of the slavers, or other
Europeans, have been the promoters of this murderous affair.
Colonel Nicolls has forwarded a statement of the transaction to
Government, and if proper steps are taken, the whole must be
brought to light.  Mr Lander's clothes and papers are all lost.
I have had a great deal of trouble with the expedition, and now
it will be increased; but the value of Fernando Po, in all cases
of difficulty, is incalculable, and I shall now communicate a little
information relating to this island, and also to the slave trade.
On New Year's day, at daylight, there were four vessels in sight,
two brigs, and two small vessels, schooner rigged, in company
with one of the brigs.  One of them anchored, named the
Renown of Liverpool, M'Nab, master, belonging to Sir John Tobin,
three months' passage.  Two hours afterwards the other brig and
two small schooners anchored.  They turned out to be his
Majesty's brig Trinculo and two slavers, captured off the Gaboons,
belonging to Prince's island, fifty-four slaves and a crew of fifteen
men on board each.  The slavers were surveyed by the officers of
his Majesty's vessels the Curlew, Griffin, and Trinculo, and
condemned as unfit to proceed to Sierra Leone.  Captain Warren,
son of Admiral Warren, wrote to Colonel Nicolls, on service,
requesting him to allow the slaves to be landed here, which request
was immediately complied with.  The spectacle was horrible.
There were several children that must have been torn from the
breast, for when landed, it was found necessary to give them in
charge to the women, to take care of.  So much for Prince's
island, that nest for piratical slavers.  If Colonel Nicolls had
three Government steamers under his control, he would put down
the slave traffic on the coast in six months, by destroying their
nests in the rivers.  At present the Government vessels only cruise
about, and pick up a slaver occasionally."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<h4>
A WARM RECEPTION.
</h4>

<p>
We bowled along for half-an-hour, keeping a bright
look-out for the frigate, but we could see nothing of her.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Sprawl, had we not better heave-to, till
daylight?  You see we can make nothing out as to
her whereabouts; mind we do not run past her in the
night."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Lanyard, I think we had better&mdash;so heave-to
at once, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
The word was passed; and after having given little
Binnacle his instructions to call him the instant they
made out the frigate, or the weather assumed a threatening
aspect, Sprawl and I went below to secure a couple
of hours' sleep, troubled though they might be, before
day broke.  We had just commenced on our salt junk,
and having each of us filled a glass of grog, I was in
the very act of hobbing and nobbing with my illustrious
ally, when we heard some one call down the after-hatchway.
I instantly recognised the voice of Corporal Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Dogvane, do rouse out Mr De Walden&mdash;I
know he is regularly done up, but it is his watch, and
unless he is on deck at muster, he will be sure to catch
it, and I should be sorry that he did."
</p>

<p>
"Why, master corporal," responded the quartermaster,
"you might have put yourself to the trouble
of coming down yourself and awakening Mr De Walden,
and so you would have been under no obligation
to nobody; but I won't grudge the trouble, so I will
do it for you."
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," we immediately heard old Dograne sing
out, "on deck, there."
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" replied Corporal Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing, but Mr De Walden is not here."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind then, old fellow," said Lennox, "he
is in the cabin, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Here little Binnacle struck in&mdash;"Why, Lennox,
what are you bothering about; did I not desire you to
call Mr De Walden?"
</p>

<p>
"You did sir, but he is not below, unless he be in
the cabin."
</p>

<p>
"Well, did you ask the captain's steward if he was
there or not?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ask him now, then; and tell him to say to Mr De
Walden that he is wanted."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what,"&mdash;(at this moment struck in
old Davie),&mdash;"I am deucedly done up, so tip me the
case-bottle again, and I will make another tumbler of
grog, and then turn in till daylight&mdash;for even if we
make the frigate out, what use is there in"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said I, "what is that?"  There was a buzz
on deck, and a rattling up the ladder of the people
from below, and we could hear a voice say, "Mr De
Walden! he is not in the berth below,"&mdash;another
responded, "The captain's steward says he is not in the
cabin."&mdash;"Is Mr De Walden forward there,
boatswain?"&mdash;"No," sung out a gruff voice, sounding
low, and mollified by distance,&mdash;"No Mr De Walden here."
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr De Walden aft there?" continued little
Binnacle.
</p>

<p>
"No sir&mdash;no."
</p>

<p>
A sudden light flashed on me&mdash;I trembled, and a
chill curdled the blood at my heart, for I had not seen
him since we had hove the schooner on the reef.  I
ran on deck, but as I ascended the ladder, "Pooh,"
said I to myself, "all nonsense&mdash;why put myself into
a flurry?"  And as I stepped off the ladder, little
Binnacle called down the main-hatchway&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I say, De Walden&mdash;Henry&mdash;Henry De Walden&mdash;come
on deck, man&mdash;come on deck&mdash;this is no time
for skylarking&mdash;Mr Lanyard is on deck."
</p>

<p>
Several gruff voices replied from below, "Mr De
Walden is <i>not</i> here, sir."&mdash;"No Mr De Walden here."
</p>

<p>
The buzz increased&mdash;"Is Mr De Walden forward there?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Is he below?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, no&mdash;no Mr De Walden here."
</p>

<p>
Old Bloody Politeful, kind-hearted soul as he
always was, had now also turned out&mdash;"Why, Brail,
what is all this bother about?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sprawl," said I, greatly excited, "young
De Walden is nowhere to be seen."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," rejoined he; "why, he was standing
close beside me the whole time we were crossing the
bar, even up to the time when I was fool enough to
<i>squir</i> my old hat over the masthead."
</p>

<p>
"And so he was," chimed in Pumpbolt.
</p>

<p>
"Then beat to quarters," said Mr Lanyard;&mdash;"the
gallant youngster never missed muster yet&mdash;Desire
them to beat to quarters, Mr Marline."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," responded the midshipman.  All hands
turned out promptly.
</p>

<p>
"Men," said the lieutenant&mdash;"Mr De Walden is
missing.&mdash;Have any of you seen him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir,&mdash;none of us have seen him since the
strange schooner struck."
</p>

<p>
"Have you overhauled the midshipmen's berth, Mr
Marline?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The whole ship has been searched," said little
Binnacle, who had just returned from below; "cable-tier,
hold, and all.  The boatswain and carpenter have
been all over her.  The gunner has even looked into
the magazine.  Mr De Walden <i>is not</i> on board, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, there he is at the masthead,&mdash;there," said
I; for as I looked up I distinctly saw, either with
my bodily optic, or my mind's eye, I am not quite
certain which to this hour, a dark figure standing
on the long-yard, with one hand holding on by a
backstay, while with the other it pointed upwards into
the pure sky.  Old Dick at this was in a towering
passion.  "Come down&mdash;Mr De Walden&mdash;come down.
sir&mdash;what is the fun of all this?&mdash;why, your absence
has put the whole ship in a fuss&mdash;we thought you had
fallen overboard."  The dark object remained
stock-still.  "What <i>can</i> the captain see?" passed amongst
the men.  "Why, <i>I</i> see nothing, but Mr Brail does,"
quoth <i>el señor teniente</i>.  "Do you see any thing at
the masthead?" said one to his neighbour&mdash;"Do <i>you</i>
see any thing?" quoth another.  No one saw any thing
but myself.  "Look there, Sprawl&mdash;there&mdash;by
Heaven what can this mean&mdash;<i>do</i> you really see nothing
there?"  The worthy fellow shaded his eyes with his
hand, and kept twisting and turning and rolling his
head about, as if it had been fixed on the ball and
socket principle; but the object that had fascinated me
was invisible to him.  Gradually the figure, without
changing its position, <i>thinned</i>; and anon, as if it
had been a shred of dark vapour between us and the
heavens, the stars were seen through it; but the
outline, to my distempered vision, was still as well
defined as ever.  Presently, however, it began to grow
indistinct and misty; and, whatever it was, it
imperceptibly melted away and disappeared.  <i>De Walden was
nowhere to be found</i>.  I looked back towards the dark
estuary we had left.  The sky in the background was
heavy, black, and surcharged, as if it had been one
vast thundercloud; but the white line of breakers on
the bar continued distinctly visible; over which the
heavenly moonlight rainbow still hovered, although
gradually fading; and even as I looked it ceased to be
distinguishable.  As it disappeared in the surrounding
blackness, even so vanished all hope from my mind
of young De Walden's safety: and remembering the
poor boy's last words&mdash;"A good omen!" said I,
"Alas, alas, an evil one it hath been to thee, poor boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Call the watch, boatswain's mate," said Lanyard;
and without speaking a word more, he, old Davie, and
I descended to the cabin again.
</p>

<p>
"What saw you aloft, Benjie? tell us truly&mdash;none
of your waking dreams, you mongrel, half Scotchman,
half Pat," said Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
I told him.
</p>

<p>
"I know it is downright nonsense&mdash;there was
no one aloft, and I am persuaded it was all a delusion;
still"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense&mdash;to be sure it is all nonsense&mdash;regular
moonshine, Benjie," said Davie&mdash;"cannot be&mdash;you
are overfatigued, man&mdash;you will laugh at all this
to-morrow&mdash;but poor young De Walden&mdash;he must have
fallen overboard when we drove the Don on the reef.
God help us&mdash;what a melancholy report we shall have
to make to Sir Oliver! but give us some grog, Lanyard,
you sticky old villain, and I will lie down on the
locker till daylight."
</p>

<p>
I was bewildered&mdash;my mind from my early youth
was tinged with superstition, but, nevertheless, what
<i>could</i> this have been?  For four-and-twenty hours,
whatever I might have drank, I had eaten little or
nothing,&mdash;and I began to perceive that I laboured under
the oppressive effects of such a recoil as one
experiences after having had the folly and audacity to
get tipsy on unaided champagne, without having
stowed away a ground tier of wholesome solid food;
besides, I now found that the blow on my head, hard
and thick as that might be, was beginning to tell; for
I was aware that my pulse was feverish, and I had had
several attacks of giddiness during the evening.  I
puzzled myself for half-an-hour in vain; at length I
came to the conclusion, no doubt the correct one, that
it was a freak of the imagination.  When I raised my
head from my hand, by which time the lamp was flickering
in the socket, I saw my friends sound asleep, so
I was not long in following their example, and worn
out as I was, I soon forgot every thing, and was as
fast as they were.
</p>

<p>
I was awoke by the mate of the watch calling Mr
Lanyard about half an hour before daylight.
</p>

<p>
"We see the commodore, sir, about two miles on
the lee-beam," said Mr Marline, as he stuck his head
into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Very well&mdash;I will be on deck presently&mdash;how
is her head?"
</p>

<p>
"South-west, sir&mdash;but the wind is very light."
</p>

<p>
He retired&mdash;and Dick having rigged with an
expedition unknown to all mankind, <i>barring</i> a sailor or a
monkey, went on deck.  A restless fit had overtaken
me, so I soon followed him.
</p>

<p>
It was now four in the morning&mdash;there were clouds
in the sky, but very little wind.  In the east, all was
clear&mdash;the morning star had already slipt her moorings,
and was several degrees above the horizon, against
which the rolling swell rose and sank as black as ink,
except where the glorious planet cast a tiny wake on
it, glittering in a small line of silver light; underneath,
the glow of the advancing sun gradually tinged the
sky and every shred of clouds with a crimson flush.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, when we looked down to
leeward, far in the steamy west, the declining moon
hung over the dark sea pale and sickly, as a lamp
whose oil had failed.  She looked as if she would have
dropped at once into the ocean, and the feeble wake
she cast through the ascending fog was dull and
cheerless.  There, however, in the very centre of her half
quenched radiance, lay the noble frigate, rolling heavily
on the long seas, under her three topsails; now rising
distinct and clear against the horizon on the ridge of
the dark swell, and again sinking on the liquid hills
until she disappeared, as if the ever heaving waters
had swallowed her up.  All overhead continued blue,
and cold, and serene.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Marline, bear up, and run down to her."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
The deadening splash and gushing sound of the
felucca's counter, as it came surging down, while lying
to, was soon, but gradually, exchanged for the rushing
of the water and buzzing of the foam past a vessel
rapidly cleaving the billows.
</p>

<p>
As we approached, all remained quiet and still on
board the frigate.  We stood on&mdash;not a soul seemed
to notice us&mdash;we crossed her stern&mdash;still all silent,
and at length we rounded to under her lee.  We were
so close that one might have chucked a biscuit into
her gangway.
</p>

<p>
"Are you waiting for a boat, Mr Lanyard?" at
length said the officer of the watch, the old gunner.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he replied, "I will be on board presently."
</p>

<p>
Sprawl was roused out, and in a few seconds we
were in our own tiny skiff, and approaching the
frigate.  All continued dark and dismal, as we looked
up at her black hull, dark sails, and tall spars.  She
was rolling heavily, the masts and yards groaning,
the bulkheads creaking and screaming, and the topsails
fluttering and grumbling, until the noise, every
now and then, ended in a sounding thump, as if the
old ship, in all her parts, were giving audible indications
of her impatience of the tedious calm; while her
stained canvass appeared to be as heavy as if a wetting
shower had just poured down.  We approached, and
as the man in the bow stuck his boat-hook into the
old lady's side to fend off, the sidesman handed us
the man-ropes, and presently we were all three on
the Gazelle's quarterdeck.
</p>

<p>
Every thing was wet and uncomfortable&mdash;the heavy
dew was dripping down from the shrouds and rigging,
and every lumbering flap of the topsails sent a cold
shower pattering on deck.  The watch had all roused
out from the booms, and were clustered on the
hammock cloths, looking down on us.  When we
got on deck, they followed us as far aft as they
thought they might venture to do, while others again
had hung themselves in a variety of ways over the
side to get the marrow of our secret out of our
boat's crew.  The old gunner was arrayed in his
pea-jacket and blue trowsers, as if he had been in the
North Sea; and the red sparkle of the light in the
binnacle glanced on the face and chest of the
sunburned seaman at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"How is Sir Oliver, and Mr Garboard, and Mr Donovan?"
</p>

<p>
Any man who has lived in such a climate will
evince no wonder at the anxiety and rapidity with
which the questions were put.
</p>

<p>
"Why, all pretty well," said the gunner.  "Sir
Oliver, indeed, has been ill, but is now better&mdash;and
Mr Garboard is nearly all right again; he took the
forenoon watch yesterday, sir.  But as for Mr Donovan,
why, sir,"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, never mind," said Sprawl; "send
down to Sir Oliver, and say that we have got on
board."
</p>

<p>
The man dived, and presently brought a message
that Sir Oliver desired to see us in his cabin.
</p>

<p>
We descended; a solitary lamp hung from the deck
above, and lit up the large cabin any thing but
brilliantly.  It had the appearance of having been newly lit,
and wanting oil,&mdash;for when we first entered it was
flaring up like a torch, but gradually declined until we
could scarcely see about us.  As you have not been
below before, I will describe it.
</p>

<p>
The cabin was very large, even for a vessel of her
class, and was not subdivided in any way.  There were
four guns, long twenty-fours, two of a side, but the
devil a stick of furniture in it, with the exception of
the table in the middle, and six or seven chairs, two
black hair sofas, one on each side of the cabin, a chest
of drawers, and the crimson curtains before the stern
windows.  The portrait of a lady was the only
ornament, a buxom-looking dame, but of the Earth
earthly, nothing etherial about her.
</p>

<p>
The commodore's cot hung well aft, near the small
door that opened into the quarter-gallery on the
starboard side&mdash;the bed-clothes were all disarranged as if
he had recently risen; and at first we thought he must
have left the cabin as we came down, and walked
forward on the main-deck.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the commodore?" said Lanyard to the
captain's steward, who accompanied us with a light,
but which had been blown out by the opening of the
cabin door.
</p>

<p>
"I left him in the cabin, sir&mdash;I suppose he is there
still, sir."
</p>

<p>
By this time the ruddy east was brightening; the
light that shone through the stern windows came in
aid of the dim lamp, and we saw a figure, Sir Oliver
as we conceived, stretched on one of the sofas that
stood between the aftermost gun and the quarter-gallery
door, on the larboard side.  The man brought two
candles and placed them on the table.  Both Sprawl
and myself had been rather surprised that the
commodore did not instantly address us as we entered, but
we now noticed that the gallant old fellow was very
pale and wan, and that he spoke with difficulty, as if
he had been labouring under asthma.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, gentlemen&mdash;glad to see you back again.
I am prepared to hear that you have failed in your
object&mdash;quite prepared; but I have been down ever
since you shoved off, and am far from well yet."
</p>

<p>
He rose and shook hands with us with all his usual
cordiality of manner.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, gentlemen,&mdash;there&mdash;sit down.  Howard,
get coffee."
</p>

<p>
It was handed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Master Brail&mdash;you have had enough of
piloting and cutting out," said he, endeavouring to
appear cheery and unconcerned&mdash;"curiosity quite
satisfied I daresay."  I was about replying when he
continued, addressing the lieutenants.
</p>

<p>
"You have had some fighting, I suppose&mdash;indeed,
we heard the firing distinctly enough."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, commodore," said Sprawl, "enough and to
spare of that; but, as you have guessed, we were
unable to bring out the polacre&mdash;she now lies sunk in
the river."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," rejoined Sir Oliver, "I will hear the
particulars by and by; but I hope you have not lost
any, at least not <i>many</i> of the people&mdash;none killed I
hope?&mdash;this horrible climate will leave few of us for
gunpowder soon&mdash;none killed I hope?&mdash;a few wounded,
of course, I bargain for"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Sprawl was silent for a minute, and then handed
him the return.&mdash;"Indeed, Sir Oliver," said he, "I
am grieved to tell you that it has been a bad business;
we have lost several excellent men, and our doctor's
list is also heavy; however, all the wounded are likely
to do well."
</p>

<p>
The commodore took the paper in his nervous
hand, and as he read the official account of our adventure,
it shook violently, and his pale lip quivered, as
he exclaimed from time to time&mdash;"God bless me,
how unfortunate! how miserably unfortunate!  But,
gentlemen, you deserve all praise&mdash;you have behaved
nobly, gallantly.  I have no heart, however, to read
the return.  You have had how many killed?" turning
to Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
He mentioned the number.
</p>

<p>
"And wounded?"
</p>

<p>
He also gave him the information he desired in this
respect.
</p>

<p>
"Merciful Heaven!" groaned the excellent man&mdash;"but
it cannot be helped&mdash;it cannot be helped.
Pray," said he, the tone of his voice changed&mdash;I
noticed it quavered, and he seemed to screw his words
through his clenched teeth with difficulty,&mdash;all of
which surprised me a good deal&mdash;"none of the
boys&mdash;the young gentlemen&mdash;none of the midshipmen are
hurt, or"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He seemed afraid to pronounce the word "killed."  Sprawl
looked at Lanyard.  He saw that he hung in the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no, sir," said he.  "Why, no, none of
them seriously hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Nor killed?" said the commodore, affecting to be
at ease, as he lay back on his sofa; "I am glad of
it&mdash;I thank heaven for it.  But really I am so weak
from this confounded complaint!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," continued old Davie, "none of the
midshipmen are either killed or wounded, but Mr De
Walden"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He suddenly raised himself into a sitting position,
and the increasing daylight, that streamed through
the stern windows, and the scuttle overhead, showed
that he was paler than ever; the ague of his lip
increased, and his whole frame trembled violently, as he
said in a weak nervous voice&mdash;"Mr De Walden, did
you say? what of him?  You just now said <i>none</i> of
the young gentlemen were either killed or wounded."  And
he looked first at Sprawl, then at Dick, and
lastly at me, but all of us were so taken aback by such
unusual and unaccountable conduct, that for a second
or two we could make no answer.
</p>

<p>
At length Lanyard rallied his wits about him.
"You are right, sir, none of the midshipmen were
hurt, but Mr de Walden"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr de Walden again!&mdash;what can you mean?
Speak out, for the love of mercy"&mdash;and he seized his
arm, and then shrunk away again, and held up his
hand, as if he could not stand the hearing of what he
might utter.  "Don't say it, Mr Lanyard; don't, if
you regard me, say it;" and he lay back, and held
both hands on his eyes, and sobbed audibly.
</p>

<p>
Sprawl and I again exchanged looks, but neither of
us could find it in our hearts to speak.
</p>

<p>
At length the old man made a violent effort at
composure,&mdash;"Gentlemen, you will pardon me;
disease has broken me down, and fairly unhinged me;
and I could, as you see, cry like a woman.  I had,
indeed, a very peculiar cause for loving that poor boy,
I fancy, God help me"&mdash;here the large tears streamed
over his old cheeks, that had stood the washing up of
many a salt spray&mdash;"that I see him now!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?" said I, like honest Horatio, somewhat
startled.  He did not notice the interruption.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he had not an enemy in the world; I
am sure he will be lamented by every man and officer
in the ship, poor young fellow.  But come, gentlemen,
enough and to spare of this"&mdash;and he rose up,
and strode across the cabin, speaking with a forced
composure, as we could easily perceive.  "We must
all die, in a sick bed or in action&mdash;either on shore or
at sea; and those who, like him, fall while fighting
gallantly, are better off than others who drag through
a tedious and painful disease.  This is trite talking,
gentlemen; but it is true&mdash;God's will be done!
Peace be with him, poor boy; peace be with him."
</p>

<p>
Thinking he was mad, I several times tried to
break in, and disburden my mind of the whole story;
but he always waved me down impatiently, and continued
to walk backwards and forwards very impetuously.
</p>

<p>
At length he made a full stop, and looked earnestly
in the first lieutenant's face&mdash;"He behaved gallantly,
and died nobly?&mdash;all his wounds in the front?"
</p>

<p>
I could allow this to go on no longer.  "Why,
Sir Oliver, young De Walden is not killed, so far as
we know."
</p>

<p>
He gasped&mdash;caught my arm convulsively&mdash;and
burst into a weak hysterical laugh&mdash;"Not dead?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; none of us can say that he is dead.  He
did indeed behave most gallantly through the whole
affair; but"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But what?" said he&mdash;his eyes sparkling, his
brows knit, and his features blue and pinched, as if he
had seen a spectre&mdash;"But what, Mr Brail? for God
Almighty's sake, tell me the worst at once."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Oliver, he is <i>missing</i>."
</p>

<p>
His hands dropped by his side, as if suddenly struck
with palsy; his jaw fell, and his voice became hollow,
tremulous, and indistinct, as if the muscles of his lips
and tongue had refused to do their office.  When he
spoke, it seemed as if the words had been formed in
his chest&mdash;"<i>Missing!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Oliver," said Sprawl, utterly thunderstruck
at his superior's conduct&mdash;"Mr De Walden is <i>missing</i>."
</p>

<p>
The old man staggered, and would have fallen, had
he not caught hold of the scroll head of the sofa.  I
thought he had fainted, but he gradually recovered
himself, and stood erect.  There was a long pause.  At
length he made a step towards us, and said, with an
expression of the most bitter irony&mdash;"So, gentlemen,
Mr De Walden <i>is missing</i>; the only officer <i>missing</i> is
a poor young midshipman; a prisoner amongst these
savages, forsooth; a prisoner!  Oh, God!  I could
have brooked hearing of his death;&mdash;but a prisoner,
and in the power of such an enemy!  I bless Heaven,
that his poor mother has been spared this misery&mdash;would
that I had also been in my grave before&mdash;But,
but"&mdash;his tone suddenly became fierce and threatening,
and he raised his hand close to my face.  I thought
he would have struck me&mdash;"But how came it, Mr
Brail&mdash;Mr Sprawl and Mr Lanyard there, I see, are
both scathless&mdash;but you have been wounded, so I will
speak to you&mdash;How came it, sir, that he is missing?
He must have been deserted, sir&mdash;forsaken&mdash;left to
his fate&mdash;and such a fate!&mdash;while you, my worthy
lieutenants," here he turned round fiercely on his two
subalterns, "were wisely looking out for a sound skin
and safety."
</p>

<p>
We were all so utterly taken by surprise at this
furious climax to what we began to consider the
commodore's insanity, that neither the first lieutenant,
Lanyard, nor myself, notwithstanding all that had
passed, could speak; which gave Sir Oliver time to
breathe and continue in the same tone of fiendlike
acerbity&mdash;"If I live, you shall both answer for this
before a court-martial.  Yes; and if you escape there,
<i>you shall not escape me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Commodore&mdash;Sir Oliver," said Sprawl, deeply
stung; "by Heaven, Sir Oliver, you will make me
forget who I am, and where I am.  You do <i>me</i>, you
do Mr Lanyard, and the whole of the party engaged,
exceeding injustice&mdash;the grossest injustice; but I will
leave the cabin; I dare not trust myself any longer.
I have served with you, Sir Oliver, for seven years, in
three different ships, and, to my knowledge, we have
never, until this moment, had an angry word
together"&mdash;and here the noble fellow drew himself up
proudly&mdash;"and I will yet put it to you yourself, when
you <i>are</i> yourself, whether in all that time you ever
knew me failing in my duty to my king and country&mdash;whether,
during the whole seven years, you, sir&mdash;ay,
or any man in the ships we have served in together&mdash;can
now lay, or ever attempted to lay, any action or
deed at my door derogatory to my character as an
officer, or that in any the smallest degree sullied my
reputation as a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
This unlooked-for spunk on old Davie's part
startled me, and evidently made a strong impression on
the excited nerves of the old commodore; especially
as Sprawl followed it up, by slowly adding, while the
tears hopped over his iron visage&mdash;"But, if it is to be
so, I will save you the trouble, Sir Oliver, of
<i>bringing</i> me to a court-martial"&mdash;he paused for a good
space&mdash;"Sir Oliver Oakplank, I <i>demand</i> it."
</p>

<p>
The commodore had by this lain down again on the
sofa, with his head resting on the pillow, and his arms
clasped on his breast, as if he had been an effigy on a
tombstone.  For a minute he did not utter a
word&mdash;at length&mdash;"David Sprawl, man and boy, I have
known you five-and-twenty years; that your
promotion has not kept pace with your merits I regret,
almost as much as you yourself can do; but, in the
present instance, you knew I had been ill, and at your
hands I had expected more"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I could not help it, Sir Oliver&mdash;I had looked for
other things; but mine has been a life of disappointment."
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver rallied, and rose, ill as he was, and,
stepping up to him, he laid hold of old Bloody Politeful's
large bony hand&mdash;"Mr Sprawl, I&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;illness
and anxiety, as I said before, have broke me
down; to you and Mr Lanyard I offer my apology;
as brave men I know you won't refuse it; bad health
is my excuse;&mdash;but neither of you can imagine the
ties that bound me to that beautiful&mdash;that most excellent
young man, Henry De Walden."
</p>

<p>
Dick now thought it was his turn, and made a rally&mdash;"Why,
Sir Oliver, I am sure that neither Mr
Sprawl nor myself would yield, even to you, in regard
for him."  He shook his head.  "Indeed, sir, we both
knew the poor boy well; and"&mdash;here he plucked up
more courage, determined in his own mind apparently
that he would clap a stopper on their being ridden
rough-shod over in this sort of way&mdash;but the commodore,
far from showing fight, quietly allowed him to say
out his say&mdash;"We both knew him well&mdash;a finer or
a braver lad never stepped; and I fancy, when I say so,
I answer not only for Mr Sprawl and myself, but for
every man who was with us in this ill-fated expedition.
Had his rescue depended on our devoting ourselves,
you may rely on it, Sir Oliver, either we should not
have been here to tell the story, or <i>he</i> would have been
alive to tell his own."
</p>

<p>
The commodore once more lay back on the sofa,
covering his face with his hands&mdash;"Go on, Mr
Lanyard&mdash;go on."
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, he was with us, safe and sound, until
we crossed the bar.  I heard him sing out, 'a good
omen&mdash;a good omen!' just as we jammed the Spanish
schooner that had waylaid us, right down on the bank,
in the very middle of the bar; but from that very
instant of time no man in the ship saw or heard any thing
of him."
</p>

<p>
The old commodore appeared to be screwing up and
gathering all his energies about him.
</p>

<p>
"Never saw him!&mdash;what&mdash;did he fall overboard?
Tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;<i>did</i> he fall overboard?"
</p>

<p>
"None of us saw him fall overboard, sir;" said I,
desirous of making a diversion in favour of my friends,
"but after that moment I never saw him alive."
</p>

<p>
"Alive!" echoed the commodore&mdash;"Alive!  Did
you see him dead, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I think with you he must have gone
overboard."  There was a long and most irksome pause;
at length the commodore broke it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Benjamin, it cannot be helped, it
cannot be helped."
</p>

<p>
Desirous of preventing another lull in the conversation,
I hinted to the commodore that I had been subjected
to a very strange delusion of the senses in
passing the bar.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, indeed," said he, with a faint smile&mdash;"second
sight, I presume&mdash;your Scotch star has been in the
ascendant&mdash;but come, tell the whole story at once."
</p>

<p>
"I have told it before to Mr Sprawl, Sir Oliver;
but really, on reflection, I have some scruples about
recapitulating such nonsense at length again."
</p>

<p>
"Tell it," said Sir Oliver, looking at me with his
lack-lustre eye&mdash;"tell it."
</p>

<p>
"Then, sir, I will, although I am quite prepared to
be laughed at."  I made a pause, for, to say the truth, I
was really disinclined to say more on the subject, which
I now regretted I had broached; but he waited for
me.  "We had just cleared the bar, sir, when, on
looking up, to see how the sail drew, I saw, holding
on by the main haulyards, and with his feet spread out
on our long lateen yard, a figure between me and the
moonlight sky, as like Mr De Walden's as one could
fancy any thing."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, did any other person see it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I don't believe any one else saw it."
</p>

<p>
"Then," continued the commodore, "it must have
been all fancy.  How had you lived that morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, I was weak from want of food&mdash;indeed
fairly worn out.  Yet that the object was as palpable
to me as if it had really been there, there is no
disputing.  I was startled at the time, I will confess;
but"&mdash;here my superstitious feelings again began to
rise up,&mdash;"he was never seen afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"Then your simple and entire opinion is&mdash;<i>that he
is gone</i>?"  We bowed our heads in melancholy
acquiescence.  "Never mind then," said Sir Oliver.
"Never mind, God's blessed will be done.  But,
gentlemen, come and breakfast with me at half past
eight."  And we found ourselves straightway on deck again.
</p>

<p>
"I say, friend Sprawl," said I, so soon as we
arrived at the upper regions&mdash;"have patience with me
once more, and tell me seriously, what think you of
me as a ghost seer; how do <i>you</i> account for the
figure that I saw at the masthead?"
</p>

<p>
"In this very simple way, Benjie, as I told you
before, that, at the best, you are an enthusiast; but
in the present instance, being worn out by fatigue
and starvation, you really and truly fancied you saw
what was uppermost in your mind, and, so far as your
excited fancy was concerned,&mdash;why, you <i>did</i> see it.
But come down below&mdash;come down below.  Let us go
and rig for our appearance before the commodore.  So
come along."  And straight we dived into the gunroom.
</p>

<p>
I had, verily, as my excellent friend Sprawl said,
been much excited, and while we were below, I had
time to gather my thoughts about me.  My first
feeling was, that I had done very foolishly in telling my
absurd story to the commodore; my second, that I
had, which was really the simple fact, been imposed on
by a false impression on my senses.
</p>

<p>
"Donovan, my darling," said I, addressing our
friend, who was lying in his berth close to us, "I
can forgive you now for being mad a bit, Dennis,
dear."
</p>

<p>
"Come now, Brail, no quizzing, if you please; I am
deuced weak yet."
</p>

<p>
We made our toilet, and presently we were in the
cabin again.  Sir Oliver, when we entered, was sitting
at the breakfast table.  He had dressed; and although
he was still very pale, there was nothing peculiar in
his manner, if it were not that he was, if any thing,
kinder than usual.  He led the conversation as far
away from the recent expedition as he decently could,
until breakfast was nearly over, when he suddenly
addressed me.  "Do you think, Mr Brail, since <i>you</i>
saw him last, that there is any, the remotest chance
of that poor boy being alive?  Would it, in your
opinion, be of any avail our hovering off the coast for a
few days, and sending in the boats occasionally?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at old Bloody Politeful, who thereupon
took the word up.
</p>

<p>
"No, commodore, I believe the poor boy is gone.
I conceive it would be lost time remaining here in the
hope of his being alive."
</p>

<p>
"Enough, enough," said Sir Oliver.  And from
that time forth, he <i>never</i>, in my hearing at least,
mentioned his name.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
</h3>

<h4>
CAPE MISSIONARIES.
</h4>

<p>
I returned on board of the Midge, as in Sir Oliver's
weak state of health I thought it better to resist
his desire that I should resume my cot in his cabin for
the present.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the hopelessness of young De
Walden being alive, still we clung to this part of the
coast for three whole days; and several boats were
sent in across the bar at high water on each day.  But
over the whole banks of the vile river there prevailed
a churchyard silence.  Not a native was to be seen;
and, on the evening of the third day, we all got safely
and finally on board again.  The night was spent as
usual in making short boards, so as to hold our ground;
and at eleven on the following forenoon, Lanyard's
signal was made to repair on board.
</p>

<p>
The gig was manned, and we pulled to the frigate.
A number of joyous faces were stuck over the hammock
cloths reconnoitring us as we approached, all on
the broad grin apparently.  I had no sooner reached
the quarterdeck than I met Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Benjie, my love, congratulate us, we are to
bear up for the West Indies at noon, my boy.  What
do you think of that?  We shall lose sight of this
infernal coast for six months at all events."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha," said old Dick, forcing a laugh in great
bitterness, "very lucky, very comfortable.  What a
beautiful station we must have, when the prospect of
a furlough in the West Indies&mdash;the very shrine of the
demon of yellow fever&mdash;is hailed with such uproarious
demonstrations.  However, be it so; any change must
be for the better, so I do from my heart congratulate
you.  But as for me, I suppose I am destined to kick
about in the Midge here, between Cape Coast and
Fernando Po, so long as we last.  None of us, Sprawl,
will cope with Methuselah, take my word for it."
</p>

<p>
The excellent fellow took his hand.  "True enough,
Lanyard.  You say rightly, Richard Lanyard.  I had
forgotten you altogether; and <i>now</i>, regarding your own
course, really I can give you no information
whatever.  However, here comes the commodore.  Shall
I ask him?"
</p>

<p>
"By no manner of means," said Lanyard, feeling a
little thin-skinned after the late affair; "time enough
when he speaks himself."
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver approached.  I cannot say that I now
perceived any difference between his usual manner and
his present bearing.  He was, if any thing, kinder
than ever, and his quizzical way of carrying on had
returned on him in full force.  He first addressed
himself to Mr Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"See all clear, Mr Sprawl, to bear up at noon."  The
first lieutenant bowed.
</p>

<p>
The master was standing about ten feet from us.
"Mr Pumpbolt," said the commodore, "come down
with me to the cabin, if you please."  And forthwith
he stumped aft, and was in act to descend, when
Lanyard caught his eye.  "Oh, I had forgotten.&mdash;Here,
Mr Lanyard, if you please."  Dick walked aft to him.
"Mr Lanyard, I had at first intended to have left the
tender with the Cerberus, but, on second thoughts, as
I may require all the people on the voyage home, I
have determined to take you with me.  That is, if you
think the craft capable of making tolerable weather
of it."
</p>

<p>
Don Ricardo was near pitching his hat over the
mizen peak, and shouting aloud for joy, but that "idol,
ceremony," restrained him.
</p>

<p>
"Strong, sir!  Here, Shavings,"&mdash;the carpenter's
mate of the Gazelle, who had been promoted as a
functionary of his in the Midge, and who had bested
to come on board along with us, was passing forward
at the moment&mdash;"Here, Shavings, Sir Oliver wants
to know whether we consider the Midge capable of
making the voyage from this to the West Indies; if
we do not, <i>we are to be left on the coast here</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Come&mdash;come," said the commodore, laughing, "no
<i>leading</i>, Mr Lanyard."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant began to think he had gone a little
too far; and feeling somewhat <i>out</i>, looked towards
Shavings for relief.  The old carpenter, however, was
not so prompt as he calculated on.  His honesty
appeared more stubborn than suited him&mdash;until he
repeated the words, slewing them a little to his own
side, to suit the emergency.  "Why, Mr Shavings,
we are to be kept cruising about here, as tender to the
Cerberus one day, and to Heaven knows who the next,
while the Gazelle goes to the West Indies, and so
round by Portsmouth, and all because the felucca is
not considered sea-worthy, nor competent to the
middle voyage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Shavings, with a long drawl, "THAT
is what you want to know, sir?"  He then faced right
round on Sir Oliver.  "Why, sir, that 'ere little
feluccre is as strong as well-seasoned Spanish oak and
copper bolts can make her.  The smell of the hold is
so bad, sir, that we has to pump fresh water into her
every morning watch to sweeten her, sir.  Strong? if
one half of her beams were sawn up into firewood, it
would boil the frigate's coppers for a month; and the
feluccre that is, Sir Oliver, would be swifter by half a
knot, and none the weaker; and her bottom&mdash;oh, it
is a perfect bed of timbers&mdash;why you might caulk them,
sir; as for her bows, I believe they are strong enough
for an ice-boat on the Neva; and such transomes&mdash;why,
sir, I would rather be in her in a hurricane, than
ere a fourty-four in the sarvice&mdash;were she even the old
Gaz"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here the poor fellow saw he had in his zeal and
desire to break away from this accursed coast, gone
somewhat farther than he intended, so making his
obeisance, he hauled off.  Sir Oliver smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Mr Lanyard, as I shall have occasion
to call at Kingston, Jamaica, and afterwards proceed
through the Gulf to Havanna, I will take you with me,
and send you to Havanna direct&mdash;so go on board,
and send me your supernumeraries.  I suppose all the
wounded are well enough to be moved now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Oliver," said Dick, "all but that poor
devil, Lennox, the corporal of marines.  He is again
down with fever."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but he will be better cared for here&mdash;so send
him on board with the rest&mdash;he is a very good man,
and you know I must be marine officer myself, now
since poor Howlet invalided"&mdash;(this was the lieutenant
of marines)&mdash;"so send him with the rest."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sir Oliver, the man is exceedingly willing,
as we all know, but his stamina is gone entirely, and
this he is himself aware of.  Indeed this morning he
preferred a request to me, which I know is against rule
altogether; still, under correction, I promised to make
it known to you."
</p>

<p>
"Out with it&mdash;what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply this, sir&mdash;that you would allow him to
act as my steward for the cruise, now since poor
Jacobson is gone"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is against all rule, as you say, Mr Lanyard&mdash;but
I see no great harm in it, if the poor devil
be really unable to keep watch&mdash;so, at all events, keep
him on board in the mean time.  We shall bear up,
and make sail at noon; and come on board to dinner,
if you please, at three."
</p>

<p>
Old Dick returned with a joyous heart to the
Midge&mdash;I accompanied him&mdash;Mr Marline was the
officer of the watch.
</p>

<p>
"Send all the supernumeraries on board the
Gazelle, Mr Marline, bag and baggage, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," responded the master's mate, now
acting master of the Midge&mdash;"shall we send the
wounded, too, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all hands of them."  I went down to dress
for dinner.  When I came on deck again, the men
were all ready with their bags, in their clean trowsers
and frocks, and well-shaven chins, on the starboard
side; while the wounded had crept on deck, and were
ranged under the awning on the other.
</p>

<p>
They had all rallied astonishingly, but poor
Lennox, who was miserably weak and ill&mdash;he looked as
if he were dying.  Little Joe Peak came up to the
lieutenant, "Am I to go with them,
sir?"&mdash;"Certainly."  The wee mid looked disappointed&mdash;and
made no answer.  Presently he came up to him again,
"The men ask if they may give you a cheer, sir."&mdash;"Heaven
help us, no&mdash;no&mdash;we have had nothing
to brag off, Master Peak&mdash;no&mdash;no."
</p>

<p>
But Dick twigged, on a moment's reflection, what
the drift was.
</p>

<p>
"I say, steward, give the men who are going in the
boat a glass of grog a-piece to drink my health."  It
was done, and the boat shoved off, and was returning
for the wounded, when I happened to notice Lennox
looking earnestly at me.  "Bless me, Lennox, I have
forgotten you entirely."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know if I am to go on board the frigate
sir?" said the poor fellow, with a weak voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, Lennox, not unless you choose, I believe&mdash;the
commodore has no objection to your acting as
steward, agreeably to your wish, until you get strong;
so you may remain, if you like."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir."
</p>

<p>
I noticed the large tears roll down his cheeks as
he turned his emaciated countenance to the ship's side
and wept.  I was mightily surprised at all this, and
mentioned the circumstance to my worthy cousin, who
did not seem to understand it either.
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean by this, my man?  No
sham sentimentality with me, my fine fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, sir&mdash;no&mdash;I am unused to kindness, sir, and
weak enough, God knows; but really, in my present
condition, I am unable to do my duty in the frigate."
</p>

<p>
"Well, has not Mr Brail told you you might stay
if you choose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank you, sir&mdash;you don't know what a load
you have taken from my heart, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What mean you, man&mdash;speak out&mdash;no humbugging.
If you won't answer me&mdash;by the powers"&mdash;he
approached the spot where he lay&mdash;the poor wasted
lad had fainted.  He now called the surgeon, who
immediately saw there was no make-believe in the
matter, so he had him taken below; and as time and tide
wait for no man, we now returned to the frigate to
dinner.
</p>

<p>
I had previously determined in my own mind, taking
into account Sir Oliver's ailing condition, to remain
in the Midge; more especially as she was bound
direct to the port where my chief business lay, trusting
to get down to Jamaica afterwards; so the first
thing I did on reaching Gazelle, was to get the
commodore's concurrence to the plan.  I had some
difficulty in obtaining this; but finally, after many good
advices, he acquiesced; and we adjourned to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Mr Garboard, who was by this time well enough
to be out of his cot, and old Sprawl, along with one
of the midshipmen, were, with Lanyard and myself,
Sir Oliver's guests at dinner.
</p>

<p>
The thing went on very much as usual&mdash;the cloth
had been drawn, and during a pause in the conversation,
I asked Sir Oliver "If he knew any thing of Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;the corporal of marines?  Why, no&mdash;I
don't know much about him, Mr Brail,&mdash;how should
I?" said he, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I did not expect that you would, Sir Oliver,"
replied I, taken a little aback; "but he is certainly a
very odd creature."  The commodore here rang his bell.
</p>

<p>
"Gascoigne, send the Serjeant of marines here."
</p>

<p>
"Which, Sir Oliver," said the man&mdash;"Sergeant
Lorimer, or Pigot, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Send Serjeant Lorimer here."
</p>

<p>
The soldier, in his white jacket and trowsers, black
cross belts, round hat, with a white tape band round
it, and white cords, or lanyards on each side, fastening
the brims up to the crown, like tiny shrouds, appeared
at the door; and facing us, made his salute, as stiff
as a poker, putting his hand up to his hat-brim, and
swaying about in the narrow door-way, like a statue
on a ball and socket.
</p>

<p>
"Lorimer," said Sir Oliver, "what do you know
of Lennox&mdash;corporal Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"Anan!" said the Serjeant, not comprehending
the question; "beg pardon, sir, what is your pleasure?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said the choleric commodore&mdash;"what
know ye of Lennox, you numbscull, the marine who
is left sick on board of the Midge&mdash;where and when
did you pick him up?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, beg pardon," said the man&mdash;"why, Sir
Oliver, he enlisted at the depot at Portsmouth about
twelve months ago.  He had come round in some
Scotch steam-boat, and he was then one of the
handsomest-looking young chaps I ever se'ed, Sir Oliver;
but he seemed always to feel as if the country was too
hot to hold him, for he volunteered three times for
rather badish frigates, before we were drafted for
Gazelle, when you commissioned her.  In the small
affairs we have had under your honour's eye he has
always, when in health, been a most desperate fellow.
He seemed to value his life no more as a quid of
tobacco&mdash;lately he has become a leetle more circumspect,
but he is terribly fallen off in bodily health, sir."
</p>

<p>
"How came he to be made corporal so soon after
joining?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, sir.  He came under my hands at drill;
but I found the first day, that the poor fellow,
Scotchman though he was, knowed more of his trade than I
did myself, sir&mdash;and as I hope I never bears malice
nor envy against nobody, I could not help advertising
Lieutenant Howlett, that as he wanted a corporal
no man was more fitterer for that same than Lennox,
and so he made him corporal; and if your honour
wants any penmanship done, now since your clerk is
laid up, ne'er a man in the ship, always barring my
superiors," here he again touched his cap, "can write
running hand like Jack, poor fellow,&mdash;and as to
spelling&mdash;oh my eye."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well," said Sir Oliver&mdash;"but what is his
general character?"
</p>

<p>
"The steadiest man in the ship, <i>when on duty</i>, Sir
Oliver&mdash;marine or able.  He never missed muster in
his life.  I never saw him drunk or dirty&mdash;the only
fault I ever had to him is, that sometimes when the
men should have been airing themselves in their best
on a Sunday forenoon, he has been known to keep
them below until eight bells were fine run&mdash;extorting
them out of the Bible, Sir Oliver."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more?" said Sprawl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he sometimes gives all his grog to his
messmates for a week at a time, whereby Bill Swig once
caught it at the gangway, your honour&mdash;and he does
gammon in some foreign tongues, now and then, as if
he really and truly had at one time or another been
somebody, Sir Oliver."
</p>

<p>
"You say he is a good steady man <i>on duty</i>, Lorimer,"
quoth Sir Oliver&mdash;"what may there be
peculiar about him, <i>when below</i>?"
</p>

<p>
The Serjeant smiled, and fidgetted about, but seeing
his captain waited for him to speak&mdash;"Oh, I don't
know, Sir Oliver, but he has a many vagaries, and
dreams dreams, Sir Oliver&mdash;and fancies he sees
sights&mdash;and speaks the damnedest nonsense&mdash;beg pardon,
Sir Oliver&mdash;in his sleep."  The commodore laughed,
and touched his forehead knowingly with his forefinger.
</p>

<p>
"Your honour has hit it," said the man, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"And is this all you know of him?"
</p>

<p>
"All and whole entirely, Sir Oliver."
</p>

<p>
"Very well&mdash;here"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The commodore had filled a very sufficing tumbler
of grog, and handed it to the Serjeant of marines.
The man <i>now</i> unbent, stept into the cabin&mdash;wiped his
mouth with the back of his large brown paw, and then,
looking as sheepish as need be, seized the tumbler in
his right hand&mdash;"Sir Oliver&mdash;and gentlemen all"&mdash;and
swigging it off, he once more raised his hand
to the brim of his chapeau&mdash;turned round on his heels,
and marched out of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
About six in the evening, I returned on board the
Midge, which had hove to, so soon as she noticed the
frigate do so.  As soon as we got on deck, and the
boat was hoisted up, Lanyard desired the gunner, who
had the watch, to bear up again in the wake of the
commodore, for whom he was to keep a bright look out.
</p>

<p>
For a week we had beautiful weather, although the
wind continued very light, so that we had almost daily
communication with the frigate, and had the happiness
of seeing even poor Donovan on deck again.  As we
widened our distance from the abominable coast, all
hands seemed to improve astonishingly, so that by the
seventh day after we had taken our departure, there
was not a sick man in the ship.
</p>

<p>
The weather had during all this time been
invariably fine, but on this Sunday evening, it had become
very much overcast right a-head.  Sir Oliver had in
the forenoon, at Lanyard's and the youngster's own
request, spared him <i>Mister</i> Peak, the midshipman
already mentioned, a very wicked little Irish rascal, but
a nice boy notwithstanding.  He now stood beside
me on the felucca's deck.
</p>

<p>
"A very heavy bank that, sir, right a-head as we
are steering," said little Joey.
</p>

<p>
"Very," said I&mdash;"but I don't think there is any
wind in it, Mr Peak."
</p>

<p>
Gradually the dark clouds rose up and up, until
they reached the zenith&mdash;we appeared to be entering
into a gigantic black arch&mdash;under whose dark shade
the frigate, about a mile on our lee bow, had already
slid and become undistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
The breeze was now very light&mdash;sufficient to keep
the sails sleeping, and no more.  Dennis Donovan,
who had that morning paid us a visit, to try whether
change of <i>discomforts</i> might not benefit his health,
and I were standing together, leaning our arms on the
drum of the capstan, and looking out to windward,
endeavouring to detect any indication in the dark sky as
to the sort of weather we might expect.  I was
solacing myself with my cheroot, and Donovan was
chewing his cud&mdash;quid I mean&mdash;when I thought I
heard something in the air.  "Hush! do you hear
nothing?"  He suspended his mastication, and I took
my cigar out of my mouth, and listened all ear&mdash;Dennis
all mouth&mdash;for I could see, dark as it was, that he
gaped, as if he expected to catch the sound by the
tail in his teeth.  "Again&mdash;there!"&mdash;a faint distant
strain of solemn music seemed now to float over head
on the gentle night wind, in a low melancholy liquid
cadence&mdash;increasing like the swell of an Æolian harp,
and gradually dying away again, until nothing but the
small rushing of the felucca through the water was
heard.  Startled as I was, still
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "It came o'er my soul, like the sweet south,<br />
  Soft breathing o'er a bed of violets."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Benjamin Brail!" quoth the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"Dennis Donovan!" said I.
</p>

<p>
And there we stood staring at each other as if we
had seen a ghost.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr Peak," said old Dogvane, the quartermaster
(in the small vessel it was a difficult thing to
avoid being an eavesdropper sometimes), "what do
you think of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Poo," rejoined little Peak, "the devil, I suppose,
is busy aloft."
</p>

<p>
"<i>He</i> don't often sing psalms on a Sunday evening,
does he, Mr Peak?" rejoined old Dogvane.
</p>

<p>
The midshipman laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, you may laugh, Mr. Peak&mdash;you may laugh&mdash;but
I don't like them kind of sounds thereaway;
and mark my words, Master Peak, we shall either
have a gale of wind within eight and forty hours"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Or <i>no</i>," rejoined Joey.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Donovan, that can't be the band on board
the frigate?" said Lanyard, who now joined us.  His
senior laughed outright.  "Band&mdash;band&mdash;why, they
might give you a regular <i>rumpti tumpti</i>, Dick&mdash;but
such a piece of sacred music as that was, is altogether
out of their line&mdash;besides, it was vocal, man&mdash;it was
vocal."
</p>

<p>
The weather astern of us was as yet perfectly clear,
but gradually the thickest of the pitchy curtain <i>lifted</i>
from the horizon on our weather beam, suddenly
disclosing the cold, blue star-light sky&mdash;which, gradually
brightening, with a greenish radiance, gave token that
the moon was not far below the horizon, against which
the tossings of the dark waves were seen distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!&mdash;who have we here?" said I, as the black
sails and lofty spars of a large vessel, diminished
by distance into a child's toy, were hove up out of
the darkness into the clear, in strong relief against
the increasing light of the lovely background,
rolling slowly on the bosom of the dark swell, and then
disappearing, as if she had slid down the watery
mountain into the abyss whereout she had emerged.
Presently the object appeared again; and this time,
by the aid of my glass, I made out a stately vessel,
gracefully rising and falling on the ever-heaving waters.
</p>

<p>
Anon, the bright planet, the halo round whose forehead
had already lit up the clearing east, emerged, all
pure and fresh, from the dark sea, and floated on the
horizon like a crystal globe, shedding a long stream of
trembling light on the sparkling and tumbling waves.
Mr Peak at this instant called out from forward&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The commodore is showing lights, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well&mdash;what are they?"
</p>

<p>
It was the night signal for a strange sail in the north-east.
</p>

<p>
"Answer it&mdash;but mind you keep the lanterns under
the lee of the sail, so that our friend to windward may
not see them."
</p>

<p>
It was done&mdash;and I again looked in the direction
where we had seen the stranger, but she had suddenly
become invisible&mdash;the dazzling of the dancing
moonbeams on the water preventing our seeing her.
</p>

<p>
"She must be right in the wake of the moon, sir,"
quoth Mr Marline; "I cannot make her out now at all."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Lanyard again&mdash;"but the <i>shine</i>
that makes her invisible to us will indicate our whereabouts
surely enough to her, for it is glancing directly
on our white sails."
</p>

<p>
I had in my time learned a bucaniering trick or
two.&mdash;"How thought you she was standing when you
saw her last&mdash;when you was busy with the
commodore's lights?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Right down for us, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then, Dick, my beauty, if you will take my advice,
you will lower away the yard, and haul down the jib."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion was taken, and we were soon rocking
on the dark billows, with our solitary mast naked
as a blasted pine.
</p>

<p>
As I expected, to any one looking at us from windward,
we must have become invisible, against the
heavy bank of black clouds down to leeward; and, in
corroboration of this, the strange vessel gradually
emerged from out the silvery dazzle, and glided
majestically down the glorious flow of bright moonlight,
standing right for us, evidently unaware of our vicinity.
She was not steered so steadily, but that I could
perceive she was a ship, sailing dead before it with
all sail set to woo the faint breeze; royals,
sky-sails, and studding-sails aloft and alow.  Presently it
freshened a bit, and she took in her light and
steering-sails&mdash;she was now about two miles from us.
</p>

<p>
The sight was beautiful; and while some of the
people were keeping a bright look-out for the commodore
down to leeward, the rest of the crew were gazing
out to windward at the approaching vessel.  I had at
no time from the first thought she was a man-of-war,
her sails and yards being by no means square enough;
but if I had hesitated at all in the matter, the slow and
awkward way in which she shortened sail, must have
left no doubt of the fact on my mind.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;there again&mdash;what <i>can</i> that be?" said I
involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," sung out several of the crew forward,
"hear you that, messmate&mdash;hear you that?"
</p>

<p>
A low, still, most heavenly melody again floated
down to us, but louder than before, and died meltingly
away as the breeze fell, until it once more became
inaudible.  Since we had discarded the frigate from our
thoughts, the ship to windward was now of course the
only quarter from whence the sounds could proceed.
I listened again&mdash;but all was still&mdash;presently the dark
outlines of the sails of the approaching vessel became
clearer.  There was now a long pause, and you might
have heard a pin drop on deck, when the solemn strain
once more gushed forth high into the pure heavens.  We
all listened with the most intense attention.  It was
the hundredth Psalm&mdash;and I could now distinguish
the blending of male and female voices in the
choir&mdash;presently the sound sank again, and gradually died
away altogether.
</p>

<p>
Corporal Lennox was standing near me, indeed so
close, that I could not help overhearing what passed
between him and one of the quartermasters.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Peter," quoth the soldier, "did you ever
read about the Covenanters?"
</p>

<p>
"Anan?" <i>quod</i> Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Have you never read about the Covenanters, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say as I have&mdash;what ship did they belong
to? they must have been brothers, I suppose&mdash;stop&mdash;eh!&mdash;let
me think&mdash;why I did know <i>one</i> of that name
in the water-guard at"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh man, Peter, you are an unenlightened creature&mdash;amaist
as much so as the brutes that perish&mdash;I hope
there may not be much expected o' ye at the great
muster, Peter, when the archangel shall be boatswain's
mate, and all hands shall be piped to answer for their
deeds done in the body&mdash;yea, when the grey moss-grown
grave-stone shall no longer shield the sinner
from the glance of the Almighty&mdash;I hae a regard for
ye though, notwithstanding&mdash;but ye'll forgive me if
I say yeer but a puir brute at the best, Peter."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Master Lennox," retorted Peter, "I have
borne more from you, my fine fellow, than I thought
I could have done from ere a messmate I have ever
had, for you have done me more than one sarvice&mdash;but"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Service</i>, man&mdash;wi' yeer <i>sarvice!</i> will ye neer gie
ower miscaaing his Majestie's English?  But weel a
weel, and it may not be the last I will render ye, so
nae mair about it, man; I meant nae offence,&mdash;and to
say sooth, my mind was away among the hill-folk, the
puir persecuted remnant whereof my great-grandfather
was an unworthy member; and mony a weary nicht
did he skirl up the Psalms on the wet hillside, before
he was exalted, with the cauld spongy fog[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] for a
mattrass, and a damp rash bush for a pillow."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap08fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn1text">1</a>] Moss.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Ho, ho!" chuckled Peter at this; "you are always
gammoning about old stories, and book-larning;
but I have you now, Master Lennox;&mdash;your
great-grandfather was <i>exalted</i>, was he?&mdash;that is hanged, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
I was a good deal tickled at this, and listened, in
spite of myself, to hear how my Scotch friend would
brook this insinuation.
</p>

<p>
Lennox replied, quite calmly&mdash;"He <i>was</i> hanged."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!  I have you on the hip now, my master,"
shouted Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, man, you are a coorse-minded animal,"
responded the corporal.  "I spoke in yae sense
metaphorically, and alluded to his reward in
Heaven&mdash;where I have nae doubt he went&mdash;but leeterally, I
will no deny, in another; for he was in verity hanged
by that villain Lauderdale in the Lawnmarket, and
sang this very hundredth Psalm, that you have heard
raised on board that vessel, at the"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What, the whole of it?" interrupted honest Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, the whole of it, from stem to stern, on the
scaffold."
</p>

<p>
Here poor Lennox's voice fell a little, so that
honest Peter, thinking that the disclosure of his
great-grandfather's <i>exaltation</i>, which, in his innocence, he
considered he had cleverly wrung from him, was giving
him pain, sung out, in what was meant for a
consolatory tone&mdash;"Never mind, Lennox, man&mdash;don't mind;
better men have been hanged than your grandfather;&mdash;but
what was it for, man?"&mdash;his curiosity combating
with his kindly feelings&mdash;"I dare say something
the poor fellow had done in his drink; some unfortunate
blow or thrust that rid the world of a vagabond;
or a little bit of forgetfulness in signing another man's
name for his own, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, freend Peter," chimed in Lennox, "since
ye crack sae croose&mdash;wha may <i>yeer</i> great-grandfather
hae been?&mdash;tell me that."
</p>

<p>
Peter was rather caught.  He twisted himself about.
"My father I know&mdash;I am sure I had a father,&mdash;and
a grandfather too, I suppose; but as to a
great-grandfather"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I say, Peter, my man, 'never cudgel yeer brains
about it,' as Shakspeare hath it; and never again
disparage a man wha can authentically show that he
had a great-grandfather, even although he had the
misfortune to be hanged, until ye can honestly tell
whether ye ever had a grandfather or no <i>at all</i>.  But
<i>none</i> of these brought him to his end, noo since ye
<i>maun ken</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, I hope it was not for stealing," said
honest Peter, bearing no malice; "that's a low vice,
you knows, Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"It was not," said the corporal, energetically&mdash;"No,
it was because he worshipped God according to
his conscience, and refused to bow down before"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The strange sail is keeping away, sir, and will go
a-head of us, if we don't bear up," sung out Mr
Marline from forward.
</p>

<p>
She was now within a mile of us, or less, rolling
heavily on the long black swell.  It was once more
almost calm.
</p>

<p>
"Hoist away the sail again," said Lanyard, "and
let us overhaul her."
</p>

<p>
As the white canvass spread out high into the night
air, on the long elastic yard, the clear moon shone
brightly on it.  We became instantly visible to those
in the ship; for we could see there was a bustle on
board, and heard the sound of pulling and hauling,
and the rattling of the cordage: the blocks and gear
squeaking, and the yards cheeping against the masts,
as they were being braced round.  They were making
more sail, as if desirous of eschewing our company.
We stood on, and presently fired a gun across her
bows, as a hint to heave-to; but, in place of its being
taken, it was promptly returned; the shot whistling
over our masthead.
</p>

<p>
"Hey-day, Mr Wadding, you had better open the
magazine, if this is to be the way of it," said Mr
Lanyard; "and beat to quarters, Mr Marline, if you
please."
</p>

<p>
"Surely a craft manned by parsons, or singing men
and women, don't mean to fight?" said little Joe Peak
to Mr Marline.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Joe, will ye," quoth his senior; "don't
you see the captain is on deck?  But, <i>entre nous</i>, my
lad, if this Psalm-singing don't stir up a gale of wind
by four-and-twenty hours from this, I shall be
exceedingly surprised."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo; you have been taking a leaf out of
Dogvane's book," quoth Joey.
</p>

<p>
All seamen, it is well known, have a great repugnance
to sail with a parson on board&mdash;that is, if he be
a tortoise, or stray land parson.  As for the regular
chaplain&mdash;Lord love you, he is altogether another
kind of affair&mdash;being his Majesty's officer in one
sense.
</p>

<p>
When we had again made sail, our friend Peter set
to Lennox once more&mdash;"You are above them things,
I knows, Lennox; but I thinks along with Mr Peak
there, that these Psalm-singing folks will bring us
bad weather, as sure as a gun."
</p>

<p>
"Hoot, nonsense, mony a skart has skirled, and
naething followed.  Peter, ye're a superstitious fule;
now, why should a clergyman being on board prove a
bad omen?  Why should a storm arise because a priest
is part of the cargo?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" persisted Peter, "it depends on the kind
of <i>character</i> he may have.  If he is no better than he
should be, why I don't care if we shipped a dozen on
'em, but a real vartuous clergyman is a very dangerous
subject to the barky and all on board, take Peter
Quid's word for it."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, indeed?" said Lennox&mdash;"and the greater
rogue the greater safety&mdash;the more excellent his
character the greater danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Just so," quoth Callaghan, the Irishman whose
tobacco had so plagued him when he was wounded; and
who now came on deck with his head tied up, to see
the fun, and lest he "should miss any fighting," as
he said; "and I'll give you a sufficing rason why it
should be so.  You sees, ould Davie, I don't mean Mr
Sprawl, is always on the look-out for betterer sowls, as
it were&mdash;why, he cares no more than a frosted potato
for such poor devils&mdash;such sure bargains as Jack
Lennox and me, now"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Speak for yourself, friend Callaghan," rejoined the
corporal.
</p>

<p>
"And so I do, to be sure; and you being a friend,
I am willing to spake for ye too, ye spalpeen; so be
asy&mdash;as I was saying, he can have bushelsful such as
we, whenever he chooses, as regular as we gets our
own grog and grub.  We are his every-day meals;&mdash;but
when he can catch a parson&mdash;ah&mdash;he puts himself
to some trouble to catch a parson; and so, you see, if
you have not a regular snifter before to-morrow night,
may I,"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Silence there," sung out Lanyard, not quite
satisfied apparently with having so long played the
eavesdropper.  "Silence, and go to stations, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
Every thing again relapsed into its former calm;
the vessel approached; and to prevent her crossing
our forefoot, as she came down within pistol shot, we
edged away, and finally bore up almost alongside of her.
</p>

<p>
"Ho&mdash;the ship, a-hoy!"
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!"
</p>

<p>
"What ship is that?"
</p>

<p>
This was answered Scotch fashion&mdash;"What felucca
is that?"
</p>

<p>
Lanyard did not choose to stand on ceremony, so to
save bother, he replied, "The tender to his Britannic
Majesty's ship Gazelle.  So heave-to, and I will
send a boat on board of you."
</p>

<p>
The strange sail, however, kept all fast, and stood
steadily on his course.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't shorten sail, and round-to, I will fire
into you?"
</p>

<p>
Another long pause.&mdash;Dick's patience was fast
evaporating; and, "All ready with the gun, there?" was
already on his tongue, when the stranger again hailed.
</p>

<p>
"What ship is that down to leeward, there?"
</p>

<p>
"The Gazelle," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
The skipper now saw that, whether we were honest
or not, he had no chance of escape, especially as he
perceived that the Midge sailed nearly two feet for
his one; so he immediately shortened sail and hove-to,
and the next minute saw Señor Ricardo and my
beautiful self, all by way of a lark, alongside.  When we
got on deck, we found the ship in a regular bustle&mdash;three
carronades had been cast loose, round which the
scanty crew, mustering some thirty hands, were
clustered; but oh, the labyrinth of slack ropes, and the
confusion altogether, and the ill-trimmed sails, and
the danger to the shins from misplaced wadding tubs,
stray spunges and rammers; not to forget the vagaries
of three or four twelve-pound shot, that had fetched
way, and were pursuing their devious courses at every
roll, across and athwart, forward and back again.
</p>

<p>
Two stout-looking young fellows, with drawn cutlasses,
had stationed themselves at each side of the
gangway as we entered.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you heave-to, sir, at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, sir," said the master of the vessel, whom
Lanyard had addressed, "I had serious suspicions as
to who or what you were.  I now see I was mistaken;
and a sure proof that I was so, you appear not
to have taken offence at my incredulity, in the first
instance."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well," said the lieutenant, "what ship is this?"
</p>

<p>
"The Hermes, bound for the Cape of Good Hope,
with an assorted cargo.  Will you please step below,
and look at my papers, sir?"
</p>

<p>
We descended, and on finding myself in the cabin,
I was somewhat startled to perceive that the two men
who had done us the honour to receive us with naked
weapons at the side, had followed us below.  The
eldest and tallest of the two was about thirty, as near
as I could judge; a dark, sunburned, very powerful
man, with a determined, but not unpleasing expression.
The other was nearly as tall, but slighter, and
of a very pale complexion.  Both were dressed in
white trowsers and check shirts, without any other
garment whatever.  Who they were I could not
divine.  They were not seamen, I at once made out.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, passengers, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
I was much struck with the very handsome figure
of the master of the vessel, who sat down directly
opposite me.
</p>

<p>
There was a lamp burning brightly overhead, that
hung down between us over the table, which cast a
strong light on his face and figure.
</p>

<p>
He might have been fifty years of age; very bald,
but what little hair he had, curled short and crisp over
his ears, as black as jet, as were his eyebrows and
whiskers, without the blemish of one single grey hair.
He was dressed in white trowsers, a check shirt, and
blue jacket.  His features were remarkably fine; teeth
good; eyes dark and sparkling; and a forehead high
and broad.
</p>

<p>
The cabin appeared to be exceedingly comfortably,
without being gaudily furnished; and there were
several shawls, and sundry miscellaneous gloves and
bonnets lying about the lockers, indicating that there
must be lady passengers on board.
</p>

<p>
We found all the papers right, so far as the cargo
went, and then glanced at the list of the passengers.
There was the Reverend William This, and the
Reverend James That, and the Reverend Thomas
Such-a-Thing; and Mrs So-and-so, and Mrs Thingamy.
</p>

<p>
"I see you are busy with the list of my
passengers;&mdash;but won't you take a little wine and water,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and the steward immediately placed wine
and glasses, and some biscuit, on the table.
</p>

<p>
"They are missionaries, sir, for the back
settlements at the Cape.  Moravians, I believe, you call
the sect they belong to; but I care little for the
denomination which their peculiar tenets have acquired
for them, so long as I can say this, that a more
amiable set of people I never have come across, sir; and,
man and boy, I have been to sea in passenger-carrying
merchant craft for six-and-thirty years."
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant now, at his request, gave the correct
latitude; when, finding himself farther to the eastward
than he expected, he asked leave to keep company
with us for a couple of days, as a protection against
the visits of the contraband traders.  Having got the
course we were steering, which, he said, would suit,
although a little too westerly for him, we rose to
depart, and wished the skipper good-night.
</p>

<p>
"It is dead calm now, sir," said he; "possibly
you will do me the favour to allow me to introduce
you to my <i>family</i>, as I call my Moravian friends.
They are all at tea, I believe, in the round-house, on
deck."
</p>

<p>
As I stepped off the ladder, I saw that he was right,
that it was, in fact, quite calm; and there was the
little Midge, close to, with her long taper yard
wallopping about, and the sail giving a floundering flap
every now and then, as she rolled about on the heave
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Marline" (we were so near that there was
no use for a speaking-trumpet), "keep close to, if
you please&mdash;I will be on board presently."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
Lanyard then turned to mine host, and followed
him towards the round-house, which was built on
deck, with a gangway all round it, along which the
tiller ropes led; the wheel being situated under the
small projecting canopy facing the quarterdeck.
</p>

<p>
All had been dark when we came on deck&mdash;the
only light being the one in the binnacle, but now the
round-house was very handsomely lit up by two lamps
hung from the roof, which shone brilliantly through
the open door and the two windows that looked
towards the quarterdeck.  The wheel, with the sailor
who was steering standing by it, was right in the wake
of the stream of light from the door.  It was striking
to see his athletic figure, leaning on the rim of the
wheel, his right hand grasping one of the lower spokes,
while the left clutched the uppermost, on which his
cheek rested; the jerk of the rudder in the calm
twitching his head first on this side, then on t'other.
</p>

<p>
But the scene within&mdash;I shall never forget it.  The
round-house was a room, as near as might be, sixteen
feet long, and about fourteen feet broad at the end
next the quarterdeck, narrowing to ten feet wide at
the aftermost part.  On each side there were two
sofas, and between each of the sofas two doors, that
appeared to open into state-rooms;&mdash;two shorter
sofas ran across the afterpart, fronting you as you
entered; and placed between these two aftermost sofas,
there was a neat brass cabin grate, now tastefully filled
with a bouquet of artificial flowers.  In the centre of
the cabin there was a long table, on which stood a tea
equipage, the grateful vapour whirling up from a
massive tea-pot.
</p>

<p>
A venerable-looking old man, dressed in a large grey
frieze night-gown, with a large velvet cap on his
head, from beneath which long white locks escaped
and spread over his shoulders, sat directly fronting the
door on one of the sofas that ran athwart ships.
</p>

<p>
He had been reading apparently in a large Bible,
that now lay closed before him, with one of his elbows
resting on it, and on which his spectacles lay.  I had
never seen a more benign eye, and his serene high
features, whose healthy hue betokened a green old
age, were lit up into the most bland and beneficent
expression, as with lips apart, disclosing a regular set
of teeth, he smiled on a darling little half-naked
cherub of a child about two years and a half old, that sat
on the table beside him, playing with his white hairs.
</p>

<p>
He was a lovely little chubby fellow; a most beautiful
fair-skinned and fair-haired boy, with no clothing
on but a short cambric shift, bound at the waist with
a small pink silk handkerchief.  His round fat little
arms, and little stumpy legs, were entirely naked;
even shoes he had none, and in his tumblifications
he seemed utterly to have forgotten that he had no
drawers on.  But the glorious little fellow's head!&mdash;his
glossy short curling fair hair, that frizzled out
all round his head as if it had been a golden halo
floating over his sunny features&mdash;his noble, wide
spreading forehead&mdash;his dark blue laughing eyes&mdash;his
red ripe cheeks, and beautiful mouth, with the
glancing ivory within!&mdash;Oh, I should weary all hands
were I to dilate on the darling little fellow's
appearance; for, next to a horse or a Newfoundland dog, I
dote on a beautiful child.  "Shall I ever have such a
magnificent little chap?" burst from my lips against
my will.  "I hope you may, sir," said a calm,
low-pitched female voice, close to me.
</p>

<p>
The soft musical sounds startled me more, under
the circumstances, than a trumpet note would have
done.  I turned to the quarter from whence they
proceeded, and saw two young women seated on one of
the sofas at the side.  The eldest might have been
about five-and-twenty; she was very fair&mdash;I ought
rather to write pale, all mouth and eyes as it were&mdash;I
mean no disparagement, because the features were
good, but only to convey the impression of them on
my mind at the time.  Her skin seemed so transparent,
that the blue veins were traceable in all directions over
her bosom and neck and forehead; while her nose was
a little&mdash;not red&mdash;but <i>fresh</i> looking, as if she had
been weeping, which she had not been.  A fine mouth,
forehead, and strong well-defined dark eyebrows,
over-arching such eyes!&mdash;black, jet black, and flashing
through their long dark fringes.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what a redeeming virtue there is in a large
swimming dark eye&mdash;black, if you please, for <i>choice</i>&mdash;hazle,
if black cannot be had, for <i>effect</i>; but for <i>love!</i>
heavens, and all the heathen gods and goddesses, give
me the deep deep ethereal blue&mdash;such blue, so darkly
pure, as you might cut out of the noon-day sky within
the tropics, about a pistol-shot from the gaudy sun,
which must be at the moment eclipsed by a stray
cloud, had up from the depths of old ocean expressly
for the nonce.  One can look into the very soul of
<i>such</i> a woman with <i>such</i> an eye;&mdash;ay, and tell whether
or no your own beautiful miniature be painted on the
retina of her heart&mdash;that's a bull, I conceive, but my
mother's Kilkenny blood will peep forth in despite, now
and then; but your dark fine-flashing black sparklers&mdash;oh,
<i>Diable!</i> they look into <i>you</i>, my fine fellow,
instead of your spying into <i>them</i>, which is sometimes
mighty <i>inconvenient</i>; and then the humbug of the
"eye of the gazelle!"  His lordship's gazelle blinker,
so soft and yielding, and all the rest of it!&mdash;poo, I
would rather that my wife, Mrs Benjie Brail, <i>when I
get her</i>, had a glass eye; a regular pair of prisms from
old Dolland's in St Paul's Churchyard, than the
gazelle eye of his lordship's favourites&mdash;such an eye
would not long have <i>glowered</i> out of the head of an
honest woman, take my word for it.
</p>

<p>
Where have I got to? where the deuce left I off?
Oh&mdash;the beautiful eyes of the fair person, whose sweet
voice had startled me.  Her hair, dark and shining,
was shaded off her forehead Madona-like; and she
wore a most becoming, but very plain white muslin
cap, with two little lace straps, that hung down loose
on each side of her face, like the scale defences attached
to the helmets of the French <i>grenadiers à cheval</i>.
Heaven help me with my similes, a beautiful demure
woman, and a horse grenadier!  She was dressed in a
plain black silk gown, over which she wore a neatly
embroidered white apron; but from the ostentatious
puffing out of the white cambric handkerchief that she
held in her fair clasped hands, with their blue
meandering veins, I perceived, if she were the mother of
the beautiful boy&mdash;and here the murder of my description
is out at last&mdash;that a second edition of him was
printed off, and nearly ready for publication.
</p>

<p>
But the figure that sat next her instantly riveted
my attention.  She was a tall sylph-like girl of
nineteen or thereabouts, with laughing features, not so
perfect as the elder female's, to whom she bore a striking
resemblance, and long flowing ringlets, that wandered
all over her snow-white neck and bosom, disdaining
even the control of a ribbon or band of any kind.  She
was dressed in some grey homespun looking stuff, but
neither of the ladies wore any, the smallest ornament
whatever.
</p>

<p>
"Is that your child, madam?" said I, to the eldest
female.  It was&mdash;and the patriarchal old man, with
true natural good breeding, at once broke the ice.
</p>

<p>
"The eldest of these ladies, sir, is my daughter&mdash;the
youngest is my niece and daughter-in-law."
</p>

<p>
I made my respective bows.
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman is my son-in-law and nephew, and
this is my son."
</p>

<p>
He here turned to the two young men, who were
by this time rigged in the same kind of coarse woollen
frocks that their <i>ancient</i> wore&mdash;they had followed us
into the round-house, but quiet and sober as they now
seemed, I could not dismiss from my recollection the
demonstration they had made when we first came on
board.  <i>Then</i> they seemed pugnacious enough, and by
no means such men as would, when smitten on one
cheek, have calmly turned the other to the smiter.
They appeared sensible, strong-minded persons from
their conversation; not very polished, but apparently
very sincere.  Dick and the skipper being by this time
knee deep in nauticals, the old man addressed me.
</p>

<p>
"You see, sir, since it has pleased the Almighty
that we should be outcasts from the homes of our fathers,
still, like the patriarchs of old, we have not gone
solitarily forth.  But tea is ready, I see; will you be
seated, sir?  Captain Purves, can you prevail on him
to be seated?"
</p>

<p>
The meal went on pretty much as usual&mdash;the
contrast to me, between my present position and late
mode of life, was very great.  To find myself thus
unexpectedly in a family circle, after more than six
months of continual turmoil and excitement, bewildered
me, and at the same time softened my heart; and
the ancient feelings of my boyhood&mdash;the thousand old
kindly reminiscences of my own house and home began
to bud like flowers in a hot-bed.  When I looked on the
calm contented virtuous group around me, and reflected
that one short half hour was to separate us for ever,
I could have wept&mdash;a womanly melting of the heart
came over me, so that I could scarcely speak.
</p>

<p>
"Will you go with us, sir?"&mdash;said at length the
beautiful boy, gradually edging across the table, until
the darling little fellow slid into my lap with his little
plump legs.
</p>

<p>
"No, my dear boy, I cannot go with you&mdash;but
heaven bless you, my beautiful child&mdash;bless you,"&mdash;and
I kissed his little downy peach-like cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You are very sorry to leave me," said the urchin.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my little man," while an indescribable
feeling crept over me, "how do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I see one big tear in your eye&mdash;ah,
dere&mdash;him pop down, like hot water, on my hand&mdash;oh! you
must either have been bad boy dis morning, or
you are crying because you are going to leave me."
</p>

<p>
I blushed to the eyes at this womanish weakness
having been detected by the little innocent.
</p>

<p>
The calm still continued, but time wore on&mdash;and
anxious to get back again, we rose&mdash;"A pleasant
voyage to you, captain."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir."
</p>

<p>
I looked at the old man who sat opposite&mdash;"I also
wish you and yours a good voyage, sir,"&mdash;and I held
out my hand&mdash;he shook it cordially.
</p>

<p>
"May God bless you, sir,"&mdash;and then turning to
the lieutenant&mdash;"I respect your service, sir, but I have
seen some roughness among young officers too, when
the ships in which I have sailed, in my several voyages,
have been boarded by men-of-war's boats; therefore
your gentleness has been more grateful."
</p>

<p>
Don Ricardo bowed.
</p>

<p>
Willing to protract the pleasure of being in such
society as long as I decently could, I remained standing.
</p>

<p>
"The night is calm," continued the old man, "and
Captain Purves says your vessel is close to us; will
you not sit down, and give us the pleasure of your
company a little longer?  We are so recently from
England, that we may be able to give you some news
that may be gratifying."  We did so, and the captain
ordered wine and water in.  By this time the little
boy, who had been playing with the handle of my
sword, for I must needs be rigged boarder-fashion, and
looking up and prattling in my face, fell fast asleep on
my knee, when his mother placed him on the sofa.
The conversation went round, the young men opened,
and soon convinced me that they were exceedingly
well-informed, and quite up with the enlightenment of
the age; while both the ladies in their calm quiet way,
especially the young matronly female, evinced a
fixedness of purpose, and a determination to persevere in
their desolate pilgrimage, with a perfect knowledge of
its privations&mdash;indeed, I may write dangers, that I
could not have believed possible in tender women.  I
have seldom spent a couple of hours more pleasantly;
the conversation turning chiefly on recent occurrences
in England.  At length, the old man said&mdash;"You have
been already informed by the captain, that we are
missionaries bound for the Cape.  My son-in-law and my
daughter have been backwards and forwards twice, and
know from personal experience the extent of the
sacrifice they make in devoting themselves to the good
work.  My son there, and my niece, to whom he has
lately been married, have never been to the station
before, but they are fully aware of all that they may be
called on to suffer&mdash;as for me, I am now going back to
my tent in the wilderness&mdash;to utter banishment from
all the elegances and comforts of civilized life, and
with small prospect of ever revisiting the land of my
fathers again.  But I shall be buried beside my wife,
under the same orange-tree, where she rests from her
labours, after having been my helpmate, and, under
God, my greatest earthly comfort, during my ministry
amongst the heathen, for fifteen long years.  Yes,
heaven knows, my cup of sorrow, when she fell asleep,
was full to overflowing&mdash;for upwards of six months all
was quiet in the settlement&mdash;upwards of fifty families
had domiciled themselves within our enclosure; and
having mastered the native dialects, we had great hopes
of making rapid progress, in not only enlightening the
poor creatures by whom we were surrounded as to the
things concerning their everlasting welfare, but in
inducing them to adopt many of our civilized customs:
for the care they had seen us bestow on the cultivation
of the soil, and the success that had crowned our labours,
seemed to have made a deep impression.  I had left
every thing quiet and peaceable, one afternoon, to look
at some springes that I had set for wildfowl, when I
was alarmed by a loud shouting in the direction of the
station.  I ran back, and found the very savages, who
had, as we thought, become attached to us, and had
dwelt for so long amongst us, in the act of rifling our
barn, and carrying off the grain.  My nephew and three
other young missionaries were doing all they could to
prevent it.  On being joined by me, we were compelled
to have recourse to our fire-arms, and eventually,
after wounding one or two of our deluded assailants,
succeeded in clearing the enclosure of them.  But my
poor wife's nerves&mdash;she had been ailing for many
months&mdash;had received so severe a shock, that she
never held her head up afterwards&mdash;she died within
the week."
</p>

<p>
"And after all that you have suffered&mdash;do you still
persist in returning?" said I.  "What a sacrifice!  I
can scarcely conceive any case where so great a one is
called for."
</p>

<p>
He cut me short&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Young man&mdash;notwithstanding all I have told you,
which yet falls short of the reality, I go on my way
rejoicing&mdash;I may be <i>called</i> an enthusiast, and I may
<i>be</i> an enthusiast, but I have made my election; and
although I am but as the voice of one crying in the
wilderness&mdash;although as yet our ministry amongst the
poor benighted beings amongst whom our lot is cast,
has been but as water spilt upon the barren sand, still,
with the entire consciousness of the value of what I
forego, I cheerfully sacrifice all the usual objects of
man's ambition, and obey what I know to be the call
of the Almighty, for it is borne in on my heart, and
go forth, me and mine, come what may, to preach glad
tidings of great joy to those who dwell in darkness;
in the perfect conviction that, if we miss our reward
here, we shall assuredly find it hereafter."
</p>

<p>
I know that missionaries of all classes have had
their sincerity called in question, and there may be
hypocrites amongst them as well as other men; but I
would ask this simple question&mdash;what stronger attestation,
speaking of them in the general, can they give
to the purity of their intentions, than by thus devoting
themselves, mind, body, and estate, to the service
of their Great Master, in the fearless way in which
they do?  No man is a stauncher friend to the Church,
as by law established, than I am, nor has a more
thorough detestation of cant, in all its shades and stages,
than I have; and I remember gloating over some
savage articles in the Edinburgh Review, in its palmy
days, when that needle of a body, wee Jeffrey, was at
his best, wherein a cargo of poor missionaries were
scarified most awfully; but experience and years have
brought thought and reflection with them, as they
often do to ancient maidens, who at forty, loup like a
cock at a grosart (another bull) at the <i>homo</i> they
turned up their lovely noses at at twenty; and before
I would now hold these self-devoted men in contempt,
or disparage their zeal, or brand them as illiterate
hypocrites, I shall wait until I see the wealthier, and
more learned of our divines, gird themselves for their
forty years' pilgrimage in the wilderness, with equal
calmness and Christian courage, and go up in the
glorious panoply of the apostle which is so often in their
mouths, amidst their silken pulpit cushions, to grapple
with the fierce passions and prejudices of the naked
savage, and encounter the numberless perils of the
desert, with the resolution and single-mindedness of
these despised Moravians.  As to hypocrisy&mdash;all
hypocrites aim at the attainment of some worldly
advantage, because they know they cannot deceive God;
but I would ask their fiercest defamers, what temporal
blessing blossoms around their dry and sandy path, or
within the whole scope of their dreary horizon, that
they could not have compassed in tenfold exuberance
at home, even as respectable trades-people?  And as
to their being enthusiasts, that is easily settled; no
man can thrust himself permanently forth from the
surface of society, for good or for evil, without being
an enthusiast of some kind or another&mdash;at least this is
the creed of Benjie Brail.
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said I to the youngest female, "you
have never been to those countries&mdash;to the station,
as your father calls it?  I know <i>you</i> have never yet
been exposed to its privations?"  I noticed her husband
smile, and nod to her, as much as to say, "Tell him."
</p>

<p>
"No," said she&mdash;"it cannot, however, be worse
than I have painted it to myself, from <i>his</i>
description"&mdash;looking across at the old gentleman with an
affectionate smile&mdash;"But I hope I shall be strengthened,
as my cousin has been, to endure my privations, and
whatever may befall, as becomes a Christian, and the
wife of a sincere one."
</p>

<p>
I was told by the captain, that the greater part of
his cargo consisted of implements of husbandry; and
that to their heavenly calling they had added that of
a competent knowledge of all the useful arts of
agriculture; so that, wherever such a virtuous family was
planted, the savages who surrounded them would not
only have their mental darkness dispelled, but their
temporal condition improved, and their wants more
amply supplied.  We had now no farther apology for
remaining.  I rose; the clash of my cutlass against
the chair awoke the sleeping child.  He opened his
blue eyes where he lay on the sofa, and looked up;
presently he stretched forth his little hands towards
me&mdash;I stooped down over the blessed infant, and
kissed his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," he said, "good-night, and be good
boy like me."&mdash;A tear stood in my eye, for the soul
of me, I could not have helped it.
</p>

<p>
I again shook hands with the old man.  And as I
was turning to take my leave of the other members of
this most interesting family, he placed his hands on
my head.
</p>

<p>
"Young man, we thank you for your visit, and your
urbanity&mdash;our meeting has been like an oasis in the
desert, like a green spot in a dry parched land&mdash;and
we shall pray for thee to Him 'whose way is in the
sea, and whose path is in the waters, and whose
footsteps are not known.'"
</p>

<p>
I had no heart to speak&mdash;so after a long pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My sons," said the patriarch, "we are about
concluding our Sunday evening's service&mdash;stay a few
minutes longer."  Seeing I hesitated, and looked
towards Lanyard, he addressed himself to him.&mdash;"It is
no great boon to concede this to us, whom in all human
probability you shall never meet again."
</p>

<p>
We bowed, and immediately the whole party stepped
forth into the air, and formed a circle on the
quarterdeck round the capstan.  Every thing was
silent&mdash;presently the old man said a low murmuring prayer
of thanksgiving&mdash;there was another solemn pause&mdash;when
all at once they chanted the following magnificent
lines of the cvii. Psalm, so beautifully fitted to
our situation:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great waters;<br />
  "These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.<br />
  "For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the waves thereof.<br />
  "They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.<br />
  "They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are at their wit's end.<br />
  "Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them out of their distresses.<br />
  "He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<br />
  "Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them unto their desired haven.<br />
  "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I once more wished them a good voyage.  Lanyard
was by this seated in the boat, and stepping to the
gangway, I turned in act to descend the ship's side,
with a hold of the manrope in one hand.  I found the
whole group had followed me, and stood round in a
semicircle; even my glorious little fellow was there,
sound asleep in his mother's arms; and as the lantern
cast its dim light on their mild countenances, and
lit up their figures, and the clear pale moon shed a
flood of silver light over all, I descended into the
boat, and standing up in the stern sheets, again wished
them a prosperous voyage.  We now shoved off, as
for myself, with a softened heart, and fitter to have
died, I hope, than I was when the sun set.
</p>

<p>
Presently the lights on board were extinguished,
and I could no longer see the figures of my friends;
but still the low murmur of their voices was borne
towards me on the gentle breeze, until a loud "yo,
heave oh," echoed amongst the sails, and drowned
them; while a rattling and cheeping of the gear, and
the hollow thumping of the men's feet on the deck,
and the groaning of the mainyard against the mast, as
it was being braced round, indicated that the tall ship
had once more bore up on her moonlight course.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
I was once more on board of the Midge.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, Master Benjamin Brail, who would have
thought there was so much sentimentality in your
composition," said I to myself; that is, said <i>every-day
Benjie</i> to the ethereal, weeping and wailing, and
very nonsensical Benjamin as aforesaid.  "My eye,
had old Bloody Politeful seen me doing the agreeable
and pathetic, amongst a covey of male and female
methodist clergymen and clergywomen; but <i>n'importe</i>,
Dick is a quiet going fellow and won't peach, so keep
your own counsel, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"I say, steward,"&mdash;quoth Lanyard, this was
Lennox's first night of holding office,&mdash;the other
functionary <i>pro tem.</i> having subsided into his real
character of landsman&mdash;"light the lamp in the cabin, do you
hear? and bring me a glass of grog.  Where is Mr Donovan?"
</p>

<p>
"Below, and asleep in bed, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Mr Marline, make sail, and run down
to the commodore, and keep close in his wake, if you
please."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
We descended.
</p>

<p>
"Fetch the salt beef also, Lennox."
</p>

<p>
It was done.  Were I a king, and fool enough to
patronise suppers on <i>shore</i>&mdash;at sea, it is altogether
"<i>une autre chose</i>"&mdash;my sole food at that meal would
be a piece of capital virgin mess beef, that had been
boiled the day before, but never a knife stuck into it
until served up, with a coarse, crisp, brown biscuit, and
a glass of cold grog after it&mdash;ay, you may turn up your
nose at this, my fine fellow, but better men than you
have agreed with me.
</p>

<p>
"That is very well mixed, steward, very cool," said
I swigging off horn No. I.  "By the way, Lennox,
have you got the new philtre, the Barbadoes dripstone,
at work?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I thought so; was that the water you made
that glass of grog with?"  Sinner that I was, I knew
as well as he that it was not.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, we have not used the water yet."
</p>

<p>
I was sawing away, and munching the beef and biscuit
aforesaid, all this while, most resolutely.  "No!"
said I; "should like to try the water; make me the
smallest taste of grog in the world with it, the least
drop&mdash;very pure and cool&mdash;capital water, I declare&mdash;rather
too strong, Lennox, fill up the tumbler if you
please; so&mdash;ah&mdash;too much man&mdash;it is if any thing too
weak <i>now</i>;" here a little dash of spirits&mdash;"so"&mdash;and
chuckling to myself that I had thus smuggled a second
glass of grog in defiance of conscience, I desired the
man to make down my bed, and prepared to turn in.
El Señor Teniente had also been making very good
use of his time, and chuckling to himself at my
colloquy with the marine.  "And here, Lennox, tell Mr
Marline to call me if the wind changes, or any thing
occurs worth reporting; and take the skylight off if
you please."  I now began to undress, and Lennox
had returned to help me.  The cool water had a
surprising effect; my spirits suddenly became buoyant
beyond all belief; so, after various <i>churmings</i>, I broke
forth into involuntary song, as the poets say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Little Benjamin, having by this manoeuvre gotten
half-<i>fou</i>, vanisheth into his <i>cavey</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here Dennis Donovan stuck his head out of a
side-berth.  "Why, Lanyard&mdash;Lanyard, I say."&mdash;Dick was
already in his berth, and sound asleep.  "That fellow,
now, tumbles into his sleep like a pig into the
mire&mdash;all of a heap&mdash;Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What howling is that&mdash;Whose pig's dead, Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Mr Brail singing, sir."
</p>

<p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
</h3>

<h4>
FOUNDERING OF THE HERMES.
</h4>

<p>
I was dreaming of the party I had so recently left,
and again I was confabulating with the mild placid
women, and the fair child was also there.  Oh, who
can appreciate the delights of female society like the
poor devil who has been condemned, month after
month, to the gruff society of great <i>he</i> men on
shipboard, and whose horizon has during all that time been
the distant meeting of sea and sky!  "Hillo, Brail,
my boy&mdash;Brail."
</p>

<p>
"What is that&mdash;who the deuce hails so uproariously?"
quoth I, more than half asleep; "why, what
is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not a great deal," rejoined Donovan, from
his berth at the opposite side of the small cabin; "only
you snore so confoundedly loud that I could get no
sleep for your trumpetings, Benjie; and as you spoiled
my rest very sufficiently last night, I thought I would
take the liberty of paying you off in the morning.
But, Benjie, heard you ever any thing like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Like what?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Why, like the noise of the rain on deck, just now."
</p>

<p>
I listened, and perceived a low rushing noise, that
gradually increased, until the sound appeared to be
produced by a cataract of peas pouring down on the
deck above.
</p>

<p>
"There's a shower for you, Master Brail&mdash;when
heard you such another?"
</p>

<p>
"Seldom, I confess&mdash;seldom&mdash;but why <i>have</i> you
startled me in this way, Donovan?&mdash;if it should
rain pike-staves and old women&mdash;I cannot help
it."&mdash;<i>Snore</i>.
</p>

<p>
No rest for the wicked, however, for Lanyard now
awoke, and began to don his garments as fast as he
could.  During which operation, he stumbled violently
against my berth, which fairly wakened me.  "Why,
Dick, where away in such a hurry this fine morning?"
</p>

<p>
"On deck, my lad&mdash;on deck,&mdash;but how it does
tumble down, to be sure!"
</p>

<p>
"On deck?&mdash;Don't, Dick, do that thing now&mdash;don't&mdash;what
if the lightning should mistake you for a rusty
conductor, man?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed as he vanished up the ladder, and once
more I was falling over, when I was most effectually
roused by my troublesome chum, Master Dennis
Donovan, whose voice could scarcely be heard through
the rushing of another heavy shower on the hollow
deck overhead.  But this time he was addressing some
one on deck, and from where I lay I could see up the
companion ladder.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mr Peak" (the little midshipman), "Mr
Peak, how does the weather look?"
</p>

<p>
It was some time before Joey heard him, from the
noise of the rain; at length, he knelt down, and
inclined his ear on the head of the small ladder, swathed
in a large boat-cloak, with the water running off the
snout of his cap in a small spout.
</p>

<p>
"Any one speaking below in the cabin there?"
quoth Joey.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I; "what does the weather look like?"
</p>

<p>
"Very black, sir, all round, but no wind as yet&mdash;it
rains a little now and then, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Rains a <i>little</i> now and then&mdash;Oh Lord!" ejaculated
Donovan; "where is the commodore?"
</p>

<p>
"About a mile on the starboard bow."
</p>

<p>
"And the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Close to, astern of us, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The swell seems heavy," continued I.
</p>

<p>
"Very, sir&mdash;it has been increasing during the whole
of the watch; the ship you boarded yesterday evening
is rolling awfully heavy."
</p>

<p>
Here some one from aft called to little Peak, but I
could not make out what the voice said&mdash;"How do
you think so?" answered the midshipman.  The man
said something in reply, but still I could not distinguish
the words.
</p>

<p>
"I fear," said Joey now, "the merchantman has
sprung something aloft, sir&mdash;there is a great bustle on
board of her&mdash;there, there, her fore-topgallant-mast
is gone."
</p>

<p>
Anxious to see what had befallen the ark of my
interesting friends, I rose and dressed as fast as I
could, and was in the act of going on deck, when
another tremendous thunder plump came down with
even greater fury than before.  I waited until it was
over, and by this time the day began to break.  When
I got on deck the sky was very lowering, and the sea
as black as pitch; and although the increasing light
proved that the sun was not far below the horizon,
yet there was not the smallest clear streak in the east
to be seen.  The whole vault of heaven was ink-black,
and I was startled by the clearness with which the
undulations of the rapidly increasing swell, and the
hulls and rigging of the two ships, could be seen.  The
frigate had her three topsails, foresail, and jib set, and
rolled so heavily that she appeared to be dipping her
yard arms alternately in the water.  She had sent down
topgallant yards and royal masts, and I could see
through the glass the people busy in lowering the
studding-sails out of the tops, so for her I had no fear;
but the merchantman astern had either been caught by
the suddenness with which the sea had risen, or the
scantiness of her crew had prevented her taking the
precautions rendered necessary by the threatening
appearance of the weather, in proper time; for her
main and mizen royal masts were still up, her topgallant
sails still set; and altogether, from the evident
confusion on board, now increased from the accident
already alluded to, it was clear to me, that if any sudden
squall were to overtake her before she had time to
shorten sail, she would be caught all of a heap.
</p>

<p>
As the morning lightened, the Gazelle, the instant
that flags could be seen, telegraphed to send a boat on
board the damaged vessel; and the word was accordingly
passed.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Dennis, I think I will go on board myself,
instead of sending any of the boys."
</p>

<p>
"As you please, Lanyard," quoth the lieutenant,
who was by this time up and shaving on deck, in a very
picturesque costume certainly&mdash;"As you&mdash;oh,
confound you, you have made me cut myself&mdash;bless me,
what a gash!  Give me some felt off the top of my
hat, steward."&mdash;He might as well have gleaned
after an Irish tinker.&mdash;"But were I you," continued
he, "I would trust some one else&mdash;confound this
bleeding.  Look at the weather, man&mdash;look at the
weather, and the air."
</p>

<p>
The air indeed was hot and sultry beyond all my
former experience at the same hour of the four and
twenty; and Lanyard, I saw, began to have great
doubts as to the propriety of sending a boat at all.
He was about telegraphing to this effect, when, to the
southward of us, a heavy shower fell perpendicularly
from the surcharged clouds, in a grey column&mdash;"You
are mistaken; there will be no wind, for you see how
even-down the rain falls yonder," said Dick to
Donovan, when he saw this.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, man, since you <i>will</i> go&mdash;bless me how
I have cut my chin!" as putting his head down the
companion he roared out "Steward, why don't you
bring the felt?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't scrape a <i>pile</i> off it," answered the Scotchman,
appearing half-way up the ladder, with the castor
in one hand, and a knife in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Bring the felt, you spalpeen, and no jaw."
</p>

<p>
Lennox, poor fellow, brought the hat, an old silk
one, worn white at the edges, with the pasteboard
frame-work appearing in numberless places&mdash;a most
shocking bad hat certainly.  He held it up to the
lieutenant.  The Irishman looked at it&mdash;"Hat!&mdash;that's
not mine, steward&mdash;that's Mr Brail's.&mdash;Mercy on me,
Benjamin, a'nt you ashamed to wear a thing like this?"&mdash;It
was the vagabond's own all the while&mdash;"but
don't mind, don't mind&mdash;so good-by, Lanyard&mdash;good-by,"
as his brother officer stepped into the boat, that
was surging about on the fast-rising sea alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, you may as well leave me the <i>kay</i> of the
locker, for your visit will be longer in that same ship,
or I greatly mistake, than you bargain for."  He here
coolly resumed his shaving, and Ricardo shoved off,
taking me with him, as I was rejoiced to have another
opportunity of seeing my amiable friends of last
evening.  We had not pulled above half a dozen strokes,
when poor Lennox ran to the side&mdash;"Beg pardon,
but a squall is coming, sir&mdash;there, sir, in the
south-east, where we saw the rain just now."
</p>

<p>
I had not time to look round, when Donovan having
put up his razor, again sung out&mdash;"By the powers,
my lads, but the Scotchman is right; it requires no
second sight to prophesy a squall anon.&mdash;There, there
it is coming, sure enough; about ship and come back,
Lanyard, or it is as clear as mud that we shall be
minus your own beautiful self and the boat's crew in
a jiffey, not forgetting Benjie there; and what's worse,
our only boat that will swim."
</p>

<p>
It is folly to despise a hint where it is well meant,
so in an instant we were on board again, and had just
got the boat run up, when the commodore telegraphed,
"Keep all fast with the boat."
</p>

<p>
Once more it cleared, and the rain ceased in the
quarter where we had recently seen it falling with such
violence; but the threatening clouds had sank down
right over the spot, and began to boil and whirl in
sooty convolutions; like the blackest and thickest
of the smoke, as it leaves the funnel of a steamboat
immediately after the fire is mended.
</p>

<p>
Under this gloomy canopy, as far in the south-east
as we could see, the black waves were crested with
white foam; and a low undefinable hoarse murmur,
more like the hollow subterranean sound that precedes
the shock of an earthquake than the roar of the ocean,
gradually stole down upon us with increasing distinctness.
</p>

<p>
"Is that thunder?" passed among the men.
</p>

<p>
"Thunder!" quoth old Dogvane, "I wish it were,
my lads."
</p>

<p>
"It is Davy putting on the coppers for the parsons,
and nothing else," said Drainings.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?"
</p>

<p>
The frigate had fired a gun to attract our attention,
for the darkness had settled down so thick around us,
that we could not have seen flags.  She had furled
every thing but the close-reefed main-topsail, and
reefed foresail.  "A nod is as good as a wink," said
I, as Lanyard called all hands to shorten sail.  When
we had every thing snug, I looked out in the direction
from whence we expected the wind to come.  The
white crests had increased, and again in the distance
the grey screen descended from the clouds perpendicularly,
like a watery avalanche, hiding every thing
beyond it from our view.
</p>

<p>
Presently this column bent at the lower extremity,
and drove away to the northward and westward, as if
a shallow vein of wind had skimmed furiously along
the surface of the sea, while all above was as yet dead
calm.  But the upper part of the shower gradually
assumed the same slanting direction, indicating that
the agitation of the air was extending upwards.
Suddenly the rain fell right down from the heavens, and
once more concealed the agitated billows beyond, like
a black curtain dropped before them, indicating that it
had again fallen calm.
</p>

<p>
"Come, I don't think it will end in wind of any
consequence to speak of after all," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you be too sure, my lovely little man," quoth
the imperturbable Dennis.  "Lanyard, pray have the
kindness to furl every inch of canvass, or&mdash;fetch me a
prayerbook&mdash;look there."
</p>

<p>
I followed the direction in which he pointed; the
column of rain was still falling perpendicularly, and
as well defined as if it had been a waterspout in
reality; when suddenly the lower part of it again
inclined to an angle of thirty degrees with the horizon,
becoming much more dense and opaque than before.
In a few moments the whole pillar of water took the
same oblique direction, until it slanted straight as a
sunbeam shooting forth from heaven.  It continued
thick and impenetrable to the sight for the space of
half a minute; when, as if scattered by the fury of the
tornado, it suddenly vanished in smoke, and the
weather cleared.  Right to windward, however, a white line
crept down towards us, like dust flying along the road
in a stormy day, after a long drought.  The roar of the
approaching squall increased, as did the swell, which
now rolled on in mountainous undulations; and
although it was calm as death where we lay tumbling
about, the little vessel groaned and lurched like an evil
spirit on his bed of liquid fire; while the tops of the seas
began to break and growl as if the very waves had
become conscious of the approaching <i>tormenta</i>.&mdash;It was
now eight o'clock in the morning: but in place of
getting lighter the clouds had settled down so darkly that
the frigate had to make the night signals with lanterns
to heave-to with our head to the southward, until we
saw what might turn up.  Sharp was the word&mdash;we
prepared to do so&mdash;but before a single rope could be
let go, the squall struck us; and for a minute,
notwithstanding all our precautions, the Midge was fairly
laid down on her beam ends, and I thought she would
have turned keel up; however, the moment we were
enabled to lay her to with her head to the southward
and westward, she breasted it like a sea-gull, and,
confident in her weatherly qualities, I had time amidst
the row to cast a glance at the commodore and the
merchantman.  The former was lying-to under storm-staysails,
rolling and plunging most delightfully, now
rising on a heavy sea and making a bow to us, and
then descending entirely out of sight&mdash;but the poor
ship!  All seemed confusion on board of her.  Whether
it was that they had been deceived by the long time
the wind hung in the distance, and had persuaded
themselves that there would be no squall worth dreading
after all; or the accident of losing the fore-topgallant
mast had confused them, I cannot tell; but
they had not been able to get in their canvass in time,
so that every thing had to be let go by the run when
the squall came down; and the consequence was, that
the fore and maintopsails had been fairly blown out of
the bolt ropes, and were now streaming straight out in
ribbons; while the foresail, which had stood, laid her
over on her beam ends.  The crew were, while I
looked, endeavouring to set the jib, in order to get her
away before the wind; but a sea at the very moment
struck her, washing the boats off the booms, and
everything else that would part company; for a moment I
thought she would never have risen again.  But there
was another lull, and after having got some way on the
vessel, she was brought to the wind, and enabled to
heave-to also.  This was not of long continuance,
however, for it soon began to breeze up again, but steadily;
and I thought, that the puff being over, we should have
no more bother, although the heavens continued as
black and threatening as ever.  The commodore
appeared to be of the same opinion, and now made the
signal to bear up; a manoeuvre that was promptly
followed both by the Midge and the ship, and old Donovan
and I went below to breakfast, leaving the lieutenant in
command looking out on deck.
</p>

<p>
"That chap was nearly caught, Benjie," said Dennis.
</p>

<p>
"Very.  Shall I help you to coffee?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please."
</p>

<p>
"A slice of beef?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Very nearly caught indeed.  I hope nothing has
happened to her beyond what we saw&mdash;beyond the
loss of her boats and sails, and foretopgallantmast&mdash;she
laboured so dreadfully before they could get her
before the wind&mdash;what a state the poor women on
board must have been in!"
</p>

<p>
"Terrible," said Donovan.  "Bad enough for the
men, but how I do pity tender women in such a
predicament!"&mdash;and here he heaved a sigh that would
have blown a candle out&mdash;"But you must have lost
your heart, Brail, aboard there; you are so awfully
sentimental since you returned.  Come, now, describe
the beauties of the fair creatures&mdash;give me as good a
notion of them as you can&mdash;that's a good boy."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Donovan, they were both, I mean the ladies,
as <i>unlike</i> Miss Cathleen, the affianced wife of a
certain lieutenant of the navy, the son of widow
Donovan, who lives at 1060, Sackville Street, as you can
well imagine."&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Dennis laughed.&mdash;"Why, you have me there, Benjie.
sure enough, so"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here Lennox interrupted him, as he hastily entered
the small cabin.  "The ship has made a signal of
distress, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The devil she has!"  We both jumped up the
ladder as quick as we could.  The frigate was steering
large, about a mile on our lee-bow.  All was right
and snug with her; but the ship, that lay about half
a mile abeam of us to windward, had her ensign flying
at the mizen-peak, with the union down; and the
signal for a boat flying at the head of the foretopmast.
</p>

<p>
To send her assistance before the sea went down
was utterly impossible; no boat could have lived for a
minute; so that all we could do was to haul by the
wind, and close under her lee quarter.  It was still
blowing so fresh, that when the master hailed I could
not hear him; but as she lay over, we could see that
both pumps were manned, and the gush of <i>clear</i> water
from the scuppers was a sad indication of what had
befallen.  I could distinguish the two young missionaries,
in their trowsers and shirts, labouring most vigorously
amongst the crew; while the patriarchal old
man was holding on by the mizen-rigging, close to the
master; evidently keeping his footing on the deck of
the tumbling vessel with great difficulty.  Seeing me
on deck, he took off his hat, which was instantly blown
overboard, and his long grey hairs streamed straight
out in the wind.  This to me was a moving incident,
simple as it may appear to others, and it seemed to
affect Donovan also.
</p>

<p>
"What a very fine-looking old man he is indeed!"
said Dennis.
</p>

<p>
The lady passengers were both below, at least I
could see nothing of them.  When we closed, the
captain hauled down the ensign, and as the flow of
water from the pumps seemed to decrease, I began to
hope that they were gaining on the leak.  Lanyard
now steered as near as he could without danger, and
hailed, that the moment it was possible he would send
assistance to them.  The captain heard him, and made
his acknowledgment with his trumpet.
</p>

<p>
We kept as close to her as was safe the whole
forenoon; and although we saw that the crew were every
now and then taking a spell at the pumps, yet they
seemed quite able to keep the leak under; and every
thing once more appeared to be going on orderly on
board.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said I, to old Shavings the carpenter,
who was looking out at her alongside of me, "if
the weather would only moderate a bit, a small touch
of your quality, Master Shavings, and a forenoon's
spell of your crew, would set them all to rights
again&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
The warrant officer turned his quid, and thereby
poisoned a dolphin or two, I make no doubt; by the
jet of tobacco juice that he squirted overboard.  He
then took a long squint before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I ben't sartain of that, sir.  The water flowing
there from the scuppers is cruel clear still, sir.  I fear
she has started something serious; I don't think she
would make so much by mere straining."  I began to
fear he was right.  "And I sees some signs of a
bustle on board again, sir; there, if the bloody fool of
a cook has not set fire to the boarding of the small
galley&mdash;the caboose they calls it in marchantmen."
</p>

<p>
However this accident seemed very trivial, for the
man immediately to all appearance extinguished it
again; but the alarming part of it was, that it seemed
to have taken place while <i>he</i> was taking his spell at the
pumps, a sure indication that the crew were more
exhausted than I had allowed for, since they could not
spare a hand to look after the fire in such boisterous
weather.
</p>

<p>
The master now came suddenly on deck, and at the
same moment a man bolted up the fore-hatchway, and
ran aft to him; showing by the energy of his action
that the matter he was communicating was alarming,
whatever its nature might be.  The pumps were
instantly manned again, and after a long spell, I noticed
the carpenter sound the well, and then shake his head.
At this several of the men threw off their shirts, as if
preparing for a tough bout, and set to, working harder
than ever; the water once more gushing out over the
ship's side in strong clear jets.
</p>

<p>
The young missionaries, who had for a minute
disappeared, were again on deck, and as well as the
master himself now took their spell at the pumps with
the crew; but still there was no rushing nor alarm
apparently amongst them.  By and by, I noticed the
master go aft, and take upon his knee one of the black
boards used to shut up the front of the hencoops in
bad weather; on which he appeared to write something,
in order, as I conjectured, to communicate with
us, as, from the increase of the gale and the sea, there
was no use now in attempting to be heard through the
trumpet.  Evidently with a desire not to alarm the
crew, he now quietly slipt the board over the side.  On
it was written in chalk.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
"THE LEAK IS GAINING ON US."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The gale now came thundering down with such
violence, that we found it necessary to clew up every
thing but the close-reefed foresail, and the tremendous
seas that roared astern of us made it doubtful how
long we should be able to scud.  The distress of the
ship was fast increasing; and I noticed that the poor
helpless women were now on deck clinging to the old
man, whose age rendered it out of the question his
attempting to be of any use at the pump.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget the group.  He was holding on
by the mizen-backstay, in a half kneeling position;
the youngest woman was beside him in her nightdress,
with her long hair hanging lank down and
drenched with rain over her deadly pale features, while
her fair and taper naked arms were clasped convulsively
round his neck, as she hid her face in his
bosom.  The elder lady was sitting covered with a
boat-cloak on the small bench, that ran along the
larboard-side of the companion, with one of her arms over the
top of it to keep her in her seat, which she seemed to
accomplish with great difficulty, as the labouring ship
sweltered about on the boiling sea.  A sheep,
apparently a pet lamb, stood, or rather staggered about, on
the deck beside her, every now and then turning up
its innocent face and bleating, and trying to poke its
head under her cloak.
</p>

<p>
A sea at this moment broke over the starboard
quarter of the ship, and drenched all of them, washing
aside the skirt of the cloak that covered the oldest of the
females, and disclosing, alas, alas! my poor dear little
boy, crying in his mother's arms, and stretching and
struggling with his little limbs, as if he had slept
through it all, until the very moment when the unruly
surge washed him in his nest.
</p>

<p>
"Mind your helm," sung out Mr Marline, sharp
and suddenly.
</p>

<p>
I turned to look aft from whence the voice came.
Heavens, what a sight!  A huge green wave was
curling its monstrous crest, like revolving wheels of
foam, close aboard of us astern, and pursuing us with
a hoarse growl, increasing to a roar, like a sea monster
rushing on its prey.
</p>

<p>
Lanyard had only time to sing out, "All hands,
secure yourselves," when it rolled in over the tafferel,
and swept the deck fore and aft, washing boats,
hen-coops, spare spars, and every thing that was not part
and portion of the solid deck and upperworks,
overboard, and submerging us several feet under water.
</p>

<p>
I thought the little Midge's buzzing and stinging
were for ever over, and that she never would have
risen again; but the buoyant little craft gallantly
struggled from under the sea, and rose gaily to the
surface like a wild-duck shaking her feathers after a
long dive; and having hove-to, we soon made capital
weather of it again&mdash;her strong bows dancing over
the advancing surges, as if in contempt, until they
hissed away under foot, like serpents foiled in their
attack.  It was a fearful sight every now and then to
look down from the summit of a gigantic sea, on the
frigate and shattered merchantman, as they were tossed
to and fro beneath us like objects seen from a hillside;
and then to feel yourself <i>sinking</i>, and see them <i>rising</i>,
as you in your turn sank into the trough, until they
appeared to hang above you in act to slide down and
swamp you, and again to lose sight of them altogether,
as a roaring wave rose between us.
</p>

<p>
Had the felucca been a deep-waisted vessel, she
must have inevitably been swamped; but having no
ledge or rail whatever, and the hatches having been
got on and well secured early in the forenoon, we took
little or no water below.  We lost one hand overboard,
however, more lamented for the time, I believe,
than if he had been the best man in the ship.  It was
poor Dicky Phantom, the monkey, who, when the
word was passed for the men to hold on and make
themselves fast, seeing them lay hold of ropes, in
imitation caught one too; but, alas for Dicky! it was
the slack end he had got in his paw, so that the sea
washed him overboard like smoke, when, being unable
to stand the drag through the water, the poor brute
had to let go, and perished miserably.
</p>

<p>
As his little black gibbering face, with the eyes
starting from his head, and his mouth open and
grinning, while he coughed and spluttered out the sea
water, looked its last at us from the curling ridge of
a wave, a general "Ah! there goes poor Dicky
Phantom," burst from all hands.
</p>

<p>
The ship had also hove to; but in the few minutes
that had passed since I had last seen her, her condition
was clearly much altered for the worse.
</p>

<p>
The crew had knocked off from the pumps, and
several, I could see, were employed casting loose the
hen-coops, spare spars, and every thing that would
float; while the greater part appeared absolutely
insane, and rushed about the deck stretching out their
hands towards us with imploring faces, as if we could
have helped them; while others, alas, alas! were
drunk&mdash;brutally, bestially drunk&mdash;and grinned and gibbered,
and threatened us with their fists.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a humiliating and a heart-breaking
sight, to see fellow-beings, endowed with sense and
reason like ourselves, debasing themselves in their last
moments below the level of the beasts that perish, and
recklessly rushing into the presence of the Almighty
in a state of swinish intoxication.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" cried Mr Marline.  "Heavens,
if they have not set fire to the rum in the spirit-room!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, a wavering flash of blue flame gleamed
for a moment up the after hatchway, the hatches of
which, in the increasing confusion, had been knocked
off.  Presently this was followed by a thick column of
white smoke, speaking as plain as tongue could have
told, that the fire had caught.  The column became
suddenly streaked with flame, which drove the
miserable group of women and men forward into the waist.
In a minute, the fire burst out of the main hatchway
also, and scorched away the two young missionaries
and the captain from the pumps, to which, although
deserted by the crew, they had, with noble intrepidity
and calm resolution, clung until this very moment.
</p>

<p>
The eldest lady was now lying motionless on the
wet deck, as if she had been dead or in a faint, with
her bare arms clasped round her child, who, poor little
fellow, was tossing his tiny hands, and apparently crying
piteously, while the younger woman was clinging
convulsively round her husband's neck, as, along with his
companion and the old captain, he now sat on the deck;
the whole grouped round the patriarchal old Moravian,
who was kneeling in the middle, seemingly with
outstretched hands imploring Heaven for mercy; while
over all, the sea, now lashed into redoubled fury by
the increasing gale, broke in showers of spray.
</p>

<p>
The whole after part of the ship was by this time
on fire; and falling off before the wind under her
foresail, she ran down in the direction of the frigate that
was lying to about a mile to leeward.  As she bore up
and passed us, the old captain, drenched, half-naked,
and bareheaded, with a face pale as death, was
endeavouring to seize the ensign union down in the main
rigging, but it was torn from his feeble hands by the
strength of the wind; and, as if it had been the last
faint gleam of hope finally deserting them, flew down
to leeward like a flash of red flame.  He then again
hung the board on which he had formerly telegraphed
over the gangway.  The following fearful legend was
now written on it:
</p>

<p class="t3">
ON FIRE, AND SINKING!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To have followed her, after having once been
pooped, and nearly swamped already, would have been
downright madness, especially as we could render no
earthly assistance.  We had therefore nothing for it
but to keep the Midge lying to.
</p>

<p>
The firmament now became black as night.  A thick
squall, with heavy rain, that had been some time
brewing to windward, burst down on us with the
most terrific fierceness.  For a minute we could
neither see nor hear any thing but the roaring of the
tormented waters, and the howling, or rather
thundering of the wind.  The shred of sail that we had
set flew out of the bolt-rope into ribbons, with a
sound like a cannon-shot, and I thought the little
vessel would never have righted again.  At length it
passed us, and cleared where we were, only to show us
the poor disabled ship overtaken by it.  And now it
was evident that she was water-logged, from the heavy
sickly way in which she rolled and pitched, while the
fire tinged the whole dark sky overhead with a red
murky glare, as if it had been midnight.
</p>

<p>
The squall crept up to her, thickened round her, and
gradually concealed both her and the frigate, hiding
them entirely from our view within its watery veil;
but the conflagration still lit up, and shone through
the grey mist-like shroud (alas, in very truth a shroud
to one of them!) giving horrible indications as to her
whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
It suddenly disappeared, and the tornado of wind and
rain drifted down to leeward.  The clouds rose&mdash;the
weather cleared away&mdash;Great God, what do I see!&mdash;The
frigate is there&mdash;&mdash;BUT THE SHIP IS GONE!
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
For several minutes, the thunder-storm continued
with great violence.  At one time I thought the
lightning had struck our mast-head; but it was the
breaking up of the weather, for with startling
suddenness a bright slanting beam from the evening sun
pierced through the dark masses of cloud in the west,
and floated on the tempestuous surface of the
troubled waters where the ship had gone down, like a ray
of hope breaking through clouds and shadows on the
tumultuous agitations of a departing spirit.  Was it
in very truth the eye of Providence glancing on the
watery grave of the innocent and virtuous, and
evincing, through our senses, that the quenching of their
gentle light amidst the howling waste of waters,
although unseen of men, was not unmarked of the
Eternal, "who maketh the clouds his chariot, and
who walketh on the wings of the wind?"  And was
the doom of the wicked in the rolling thunder?  The
thought stirred me like a trumpet-note.
</p>

<p>
The sunbeam travelled on, as if drifting before the
wind, until it glanced on the dark hull, and lofty spars,
and storm staysails of the noble frigate; and the
weather moderating at the same time, we ran off the
wind to close the commodore, sailing over the spot
where the ship had foundered, as near as we could
judge.  Several hencoops and spars were floating about;
but the whole crew were gone to "where the wicked
cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest."
</p>

<p>
"Keep her away a bit," sung out Lennox, in a
sharp excited tone, from forward&mdash;"keep her away a
bit, Mr Lanyard, there is something struggling in the
water close to.  More yet&mdash;more yet," as the noble
fellow fastened a rope round his waist; "that will
do&mdash;now, messmates, hold on, and mind you haul me
in if I miss."  In a twinkling the poor fellow was
overboard, striking out gallantly amongst the choking spray.
</p>

<p>
"I see the object," I exclaimed, forgetting all
etiquette in the excitement of the moment, "that is
flashing and struggling in the water; whatever it may
be, he has it; down with the helm, and bring her to
the wind; down with it, hard-a-lee.  He has it&mdash;he
has it!&mdash;No, missed it, by Heaven!  No, no, he has
fast hold; gently, haul him in, men&mdash;gently, that's it;
now, handsomely, in with him.  Hurra, well done,
Lennox!  You are on board again, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what <i>have</i> they hauled in with him?" said
Donovan, who was standing aft beside me, while
Lennox was got on board at the bows.  I was myself
confoundedly puzzled.  "A sheep, and a bundle of clouts,
ha, ha, ha!" shouted Joe Peak.  I jumped forward.
A bundle of clouts&mdash;alas, alas! it was the breathless
body of the beautiful child I had seen on board the ship.
</p>

<p>
It was lashed to the neck of the pet lamb with a
silk handkerchief, and now lay at my feet a little blue
and ghastly corpse.  I snatched it up in my arms,
more from the impulse of the moment, than any
expectation of the ethereal spark being still present in
the little cold clammy body; and, to the great
surprise of the crew, I called Lennox, and desiring him
to get some hot salt in a piece of flannel, and two bottles
of hot water, and to bring some warm cloths into the
cabin immediately, I descended, stripped the child, and
drying his little limbs with a piece of blanket, clapped
him into my own berth&mdash;Donovan and Lennox followed;
and, against all appearances, we set to, and chafed
and manipulated the frigid limbs of the darling boy, and
applied hot bottles to his feet, and the hot salt to his
little chest and stomach; but it was all in vain.  It was
a moving sight to see great rough bushy-whiskered
hard-a-weather seamen, in despite of all formality and
discipline, struggling like children at a <i>raree show</i> to
get a peep at what was going on below, through the
open skylight that ventilated the little well cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my poor little fellow, you are gone; your
unhappy mother might have spared her dying heart the
pang of parting with you, when she made you fast to
the lamb&mdash;you would then at least have died in her
arms, and beside her heart, my sweet child!"  As I
said this, Donovan, Dick Lanyard, who had now joined
us, and Lennox, the latter all dripping with sea water,
and still pale and breathless with his recent exertions,
were standing looking down on the body of the child,
having done all they could, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
The tears were rolling down the Scotch lad's cheek,
and Dennis, honest fellow, once or twice blew his nose
very suspiciously, contriving during the trumpetings
to steal a small swab at his eyes, lest the share which
the old lady in Sackville Street, Dublin, had in him,
might become too apparent.
</p>

<p>
"He is gone," said Lennox, after a long pause, as
he stepped to the berth, with the intention of covering
the dead body with the sheet.  He no sooner stooped
down, however, than he suddenly started back, and held
up his hand to attract our attention.  I looked&mdash;one
eyelid quivered&mdash;it opened a little, then shut again, and
again the aguish appearance passed over it; the
chest heaved, and the little sufferer drew a long sigh.
"He lives, he lives!" said Lennox, in a low voice,
and speaking as if he was himself choking.  The
word was passed through the skylight to the
warm-hearted expectants clustered round it on their knees
on the deck above.  My eye, what a row!  They
instantly jumped to their feet, and began to caper
about overhead as if a legion of dancing devils had
suddenly possessed them.
</p>

<p>
"He's alive," shouted one poor fellow, "and we
can now spare Dicky Phantom."
</p>

<p>
"Forward with you, men," sung out Mr Wadding;
"forward with you; how dare you lumber the quarterdeck
in that way, with your lubberly carcasses?"
</p>

<p>
We now increased our exertions, and had the
inexpressible pleasure of seeing them crowned with
success; and having poured some tepid wine and water
down the child's throat&mdash;he was as yet too weak to
drink it himself, or to speak&mdash;we had the happiness
to see him open wide his fine dark blue eyes, and take
a steady, and apparently, a conscious look at us; and
presently his respiration, though as yet slow and
sigh-like, became regular; the animal heat of his body
over his heart began to be perceptible&mdash;the blue clayey
colour of his skin and face, the sharpness of his
features, and the blackness of his shrunk lips, began to
fade and give way before the accelerating circulation&mdash;and
after coughing up a large quantity of salt water,
he turned his little face to the ship's side, and fell into
a sound sleep.
</p>

<p>
By this time it was near sunset, and the gale was
rapidly abating, but the sea was still very high.  We
ran down and closed the commodore, keeping him in
view the whole night.
</p>

<p>
Donovan and I were sitting in the cabin regaling
ourselves with a glass of grog, about nine o'clock in
the evening&mdash;"I say, Benjie, how that poor little
fellow snores&mdash;do you hear him?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, and it is music to mine ear, my darling.
What a scene it must have been when the ship
foundered!  I am glad we did not see it, Donovan."
</p>

<p>
"And so am I&mdash;why, we have rather had a stirring
time of it lately, a number of odd circumstances have
happened; but what do you make of the commodore's
taking on so, as you and Sprawl said he did, when he
heard that young De Walden was missing&mdash;had he
any hand in the young chap, think you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said I laughing, "none; besides he
used to keep him tighter set up than any other mid in
the ship.  However, that would neither make nor
mend as to the probability of your surmise, Donovan;
but I verily believe he was no connexion of the
commodore's."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Dennis, "give me t'other glass
of swizzle, Lennox&mdash;thank ye.  I say, Lennox, my
lad&mdash;gallant conduct enough that of yours&mdash;after having
been so ill too&mdash;I wonder you had strength."  The
man bowed.&mdash;"Now since I have had time to consider,
what <i>are</i> you going to do with the child there, Dick?"
said Donovan.
</p>

<p>
"Send him on board Gazelle, I presume, when the
weather moderates&mdash;but, good-night, I am off to my
cot&mdash;who has the watch, Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr Peak, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to keep close to the commodore, and
call me the instant any thing worth reporting occurs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"How is the weather?"
</p>

<p>
"Clearing away fast, sir," answered the marine&mdash;"and
the sea is greatly gone down."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, let them trim by the commodore, do
you hear&mdash;keep way with him, but no more; Sir
Oliver likes no one to run past him&mdash;tell Mr Peak so."
</p>

<p>
"I will, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now, good-night, Brail&mdash;good-night, Dennis, dear."

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
</h3>

<h4>
DICKY PHANTOM&mdash;YARN SPINNING.
</h4>

<p>
When I awoke next morning, the first thing I did
was to reconnoitre how our little and most unexpected
visitor held out.  There lay the fair child, steeped in
a balmy slumber, with his downy cheeks as peachlike
and blooming as ever; even his hair, with the crystallized
salt sparkling amongst it, once more curled thick
and clustering round his magnificent forehead.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Art them a thing of mortal birth,<br />
  Whose happy home is on our earth?<br />
  Does human blood with life embue<br />
  Those wandering veins of heavenly blue,<br />
  That stray along thy forehead fair,<br />
  Lost 'mid a gleam of golden hair?<br />
  Oh, can that light and airy breath<br />
  Steal from a being doomed to death;<br />
  Those features to the grave be sent,<br />
  In sleep thus mutely eloquent?<br />
  Or art thou what thy form would seem,<br />
  The phantom of a blessed dream?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As I stooped over him he awoke, and stretched out
his arms in the evident expectation of clasping some
one that he had been accustomed to lie beside;
alas! they touched the cold hard ship's side.  He grew
startled, and called on his mother and then on his
father, on his grandfather, and his dear aunt Emily,
waiting between each exclamation for the wonted caress
or answer.  His eye caught mine&mdash;he looked
surprised, and peered anxiously all about the cabin, until
at last, as if he really had comprehended the full
extent of his desolation, he began to cry bitterly, and to
sob as if his little heart would have burst.  Lennox
and I did every thing in our power to pacify him;
but who could come in stead to him of those whose
hearts were now cold for ever?  I could not stand it,
and went on deck, leaving him in the hands of the
steward.
</p>

<p>
The weather was now clear, and the sea had gone
down; the frigate was about a mile and a half on our
lee-bow, carrying all sail, so that we had to crack on
to keep up with her.  During that forenoon and the
following day we had no communication together;
but about 11 A.M. on the third day after the ship had
foundered, we got so well placed on her quarter as
to be able to communicate without trumpets.
</p>

<p>
The commodore hailed first&mdash;"Sad accident that
t'other day, Mr Lanyard."
</p>

<p>
"Very, sir."
</p>

<p>
"All hands lost, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
Before Dick could answer, he continued, evidently
in great amazement, "What child is that, Mr Brail?"  I
looked round, and was a good deal surprised to see the
figure the little stranger now cut.  When picked up
he had nothing on but his little frock and shift, which
had been torn in the getting of him in; so Lennox
and the sailmaker had rigged him in a tiny
check-frock, with white lappels, a pair of little duck trowsers,
with large horn buttons; very wide at the feet, and
very tight at the waist&mdash;cut in the very extreme of
nautical dandyism; little white canvass shoes, and a
small tarpauling hat.  They had even hung by a piece
of spunyarn a small horn-handled clasp-knife round
his neck, so that he was a complete topman in miniature.
</p>

<p>
Childlike, for he could not have been three years old
at the most, he had already taken to the men, and was
playing with the pet lamb, that was making believe
to buck him with its head; and indeed every now and
then it would knock over the little fellow, but without
hurting him, and roll about with him on the deck.
</p>

<p>
"What child is that?  And I see you have some
live stock&mdash;where got you the sheep?"
</p>

<p>
"The child was picked up, lashed to the lamb, Sir
Oliver, when the ship went down."
</p>

<p>
"Come on board, and dine with me at three, Mr
Brail&mdash;you can tell me all about it then&mdash;come also, Mr
Lanyard, and bring the picaniny with you."
</p>

<p>
We sheered off again; and it was laughable to
notice the crowd of heads out of the frigate's ports
the instant the little fellow was noticed on our decks.
Immediately after this a group of men were sitting in
the bows of the felucca with the child amongst them.
Lennox came up to me and touched his forehead&mdash;"The
little fellow told me his name was William
Howard, sir; probably you would like to set it down
as a clew to find out his friends when we get to England."
</p>

<p>
"A very proper precaution, Lennox, and well
thought of; but are you sure that was the name the
child answered to."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, sir; if you will step here, sir, you will be
satisfied of it."  I followed him a pace or two nearer
the group playing with the child.
</p>

<p>
"Dogvane," said Lennox&mdash;the man answered;
"Wilcox," another seaman pricked up his ears, both
a good deal surprised at the steward's address, with me
at his back&mdash;but all this time the boy was tumbling
about amongst the men, taking no notice either of
Lennox or me.
</p>

<p>
"William Howard," said Lennox.  "What you
want?" promptly said the child, as he knocked off
from his play, and looked steadfastly at the marine.
</p>

<p>
"A good and satisfactory proof," said I; "I will
make a note of it, Lennox."
</p>

<p>
Lanyard and I, some time after this, were walking
backwards and forwards on the small quarterdeck,
talking of I don't remember what, when we perceived
a stir amongst the men forward, and an attempt
evidently making amongst them to shove old Dogvane
aft with some communication to the captain.  He
appeared reluctant to be thrust forward as spokesman,
and waxed very emphatic in his gestures to the group,
who were all talking at the same time, and laughing with
each other, as they closed round the old quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"Come, there is more rain than wind in that
squall," said I to Donovan, looking towards the group.
"What request, think you, is to be made now, Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't conjecture for the life of me," said he.
</p>

<p>
Dogvane now took a fresh quid, by way of gaining
courage, I suppose, to enter on his embassy; and
advancing a step from the rest, he cast his eyes on the
deck, and began to thump one hand on another, and
to mutter with his lips, as if he had been rehearsing
a speech.  Presently, giving his trowsers a hitch, and
his quid a cruel <i>chirt</i>, he looked towards us, in act to
advance, as it were, but his heart again failed him; so
with another pull at his waistband, and a tremendous
chew of his quid, which made the tobacco juice squirt
from both corners of his mouth, he hove about again,
apparently in despair and discomfiture, and joined the
others, who instantly set up a loud laugh.
</p>

<p>
Lennox, I saw, had now slid round to the men, and
with a most quizzical cast of his eye, was using his
powers of persuasion with old Dogvane, to get him
to weigh anchor, and set forth on his mission again;
but the quartermaster shook his head, and seemed
to refuse point-blank.  At length, after a great
deal of bother, the steward appeared to have screwed
his courage to the sticking place, for he now advanced
to within a couple of yards of where we stood&mdash;the
group behind creeping up after him.  He kept rubbing
the back of his hand across his muzzle, and coughing
and clearing his voice, and every now and then he
took a squint over his shoulder, to see, in case his
memory should fail him, that he was in immediate
communication with his reserve.  After another stiff
mastication, and a devil of a hitch, he smoothed down
his forelock, tore his hat off his head, as if it had been
a divot, as Lennox might have said, and then broke
ground to the following purport&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You sees, your honour, and Mr Donovan,
there&mdash;gentlemen both"&mdash;A considerable pause, during
which he seemed awfully puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"I am gravelled already, Lennox," quoth he, over
his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Lennox, "try again, man, try again."
</p>

<p>
"May it please you, sir&mdash;it has blowed half a gale
of wind some two days agone, as mayhap your honour
knows"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Lanyard could not help smiling for the soul of him.
"Why, Dogvane, I have reason good to know that;
but what <i>would</i> you be after?  Come to the point, man."
</p>

<p>
"And so I would, captain, if I only knowed how
to get there&mdash;I fear the point he speaks of lies in the
wind's eye, and that I shan't fetch it" (aside to
Lennox)&mdash;"but, as I says before, your honour, we had a
sniffler some two days agone, and the parrot, Wapping
Poll, your honour, why she was blown overboard, your
honour; and as a parrot is not of the gull specie your
honour, I fears as how poor Poll may have been
drowned."
</p>

<p>
I could scarcely keep my gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Why, assume that the bird is drowned then, Dogvane,
and get on."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, with all submission, I have no sartainty
of that.  A bird that can speak, must think; and it's
no impossibility, in my mind, in Poll being at this
moment cruising as mate of the watch on the back of
a wild-duck&mdash;but then a duck does dive now and then,
to be sure."&mdash;I now suspected he had strengthened his
nerves a little with a glass of grog.&mdash;"However, Poll
might take a flight to air her pinions lest they should
mildew, during the time the other was below, you
know, sir&mdash;if she only knowed <i>where</i> he might rise
again.  Still a gull would be her chance as for
that&mdash;no diving in a gull, your honour."
</p>

<p>
"But my good man"&mdash;the lieutenant, I saw, was
not over well pleased to perceive that the old fellow
was a sheet or so in the wind, and still less with the
freedom of the jest, if jest it was meant for&mdash;"will
you, I again ask you, come to the point, Dogvane&mdash;what
<i>would</i> you be at?  I can't stand all day palavering
here, unless you know your own mind," and he
turned away.
</p>

<p>
His rebuke seemed to rouse Dogvane, who now
making a sudden effort, sung out quick and sharp&mdash;"Then
the parrot's overboard and drowned, sir.&mdash;And
the monkey is drowned too, sir, and the old cat
is dead below with the damp and cold; and we shall
all be starved for want of a pet, sir."  Here he slewed
his head backwards.  "D&mdash;n your eyes, Jack Lennox,
will <i>that</i> serve your turn, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see, I see," said Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"There," said Dogvane, giving a skip, and turning
a joyful countenance over his shoulder to the group
behind him&mdash;"There, his honour <i>sees</i>&mdash;did not I tell
you so?&mdash;why, I thank your honour&mdash;we all thanks
you kindly, sir; and such care as we shall take of
him&mdash;oh, my eye!  But all I says is, thank your
honour again in the name of the whole bunch of us."  He
made his salaam, and he and his tail turned to
bundle forward.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I know now what you would be at, Dogvane,"
said the lieutenant.  On this the old quartermaster
came to the wind again, his face evincing great
chagrin and vexation at the idea generated by Lanyard's
manner, that after all his lucid explanation, his
captain might still be unenlightened.  "I presume that
having lost all your pets"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes, sir,&mdash;that's it."
</p>

<p>
"That having lost all your pets, you want to ask
me for the sheep that you have picked up."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no,"&mdash;ran amongst the men; and old
Dogvane slid out with a jet of tobacco juice&mdash;"D&mdash;n
the sheep entirely&mdash;beg your honour's pardon&mdash;but,
Jack Lennox, there, take my oar now, will ye&mdash;I can
make nothing of it&mdash;I can't pull a-head at all&mdash;it has
been all back water with me;" and so saying he made
his obeisance, and slunk away amongst the people,
slewing his head from side to side, and smiting his
thigh, as if he were saying&mdash;"Poo, poo, you see the
captain won't understand, do as you will&mdash;indeed, he
does not want to understand, you see."
</p>

<p>
The marine, on the retreat of the quartermaster,
now came forward as a reserve, and in good set terms,
leaving his northern accent out of the account,
preferred a request on behalf of his shipmates, not for
the sheep, but in the destruction of all the other pet
creatures during the gale, he made out a strong case,
which could only be met by your giving up the child;
which, as a sweetener, I presume, he promised should
succeed the defunct monkey, Dicky Phantom, in all his
honours and perquisites; and "although we all know
his name to be Will Howard," said he, in conclusion,
"we request your permission, sir, to christen him
afresh, and to give him the name Dicky sailed under,
as an earnest of future kindness to himself, and a
tribute of respect to the poor brute, who has hitherto
afforded us so much amusement."
</p>

<p>
I was a good deal tickled at all this.
</p>

<p>
"But, men, you all heard Sir Oliver desire the
child to be sent on board the frigate," said Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
Here several voices grumbled&mdash;"Why they have
two monkeys on board, and a kangaroo, and a hog in
armour; and&mdash;oh, surely, they won't grab <i>him</i> too!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, we must leave it to you," said Lennox;
"if the commodore is in earnest in taking Dicky
Phantom from us&mdash;surely he will spare us one of the
monkeys.  But I am sure no one will take such care
of him in the frigate, as I should here, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Dick, good-naturedly, "I will
see what can be done; in the mean time, get the child
ready to accompany me in the boat when I go on board
to dinner.  But where are his clothes?&mdash;you can't
send him in that rig?"
</p>

<p>
The marine laughed.  "Why, sir, his own clothes
are all torn in pieces, and he has no others made;
indeed, our sail-maker says he could no more make a
petticoat than a gown for the Pope, sir."
</p>

<p>
There was no help for it; and at half-past two,
Donovan, Lanyard, and I found ourselves in the stern
sheets of the small boat, with Dicky Phantom sitting
beside us, dressed out like a Lilliputian boarder.
As we pulled on board, I had time to look more
minutely at the equipment of the boy.  As already
mentioned, he was dressed in trowsers, check shirt,
and little tarpauling hat, with the word Midge painted
in large letters on a scroll on the front of it; but they
had now added a little cutlass, ground down from a
piece of iron hoop, and bound round his waist by a
black belt; and as a tiptop finish to his equipment,
they had fastened an oakum queue to his curly wig,
that hung down over the waistband of his little
breeches.  Dick's natural bashfulness was sorely tested
when we got alongside, and found the ship swarming in
all directions with busy grinning faces, wherever they
could get a squint at us and our little passenger; and
when I stepped on deck, I had not the courage to take
the child up, but left him in the boat.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Mr Brail?&mdash;glad to see you, Mr
Lanyard&mdash;Mr Donovan, I hope you are better," said
Sir Oliver.  We made our acknowledgments.  "Where
is your little passenger, Mr Lanyard.  Have you
brought him on board?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, Sir Oliver, he is in the boat alongside,
but the people have so monkeyfied him, that he is
scarcely presentable on the quarterdeck."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, hand him up&mdash;hand him up&mdash;let
us see him."  And poor little Dicky Phantom was
straightway transferred from the stern-sheets of the
boat to the frigate's deck, amidst a buzz of laughter
from officers and men.
</p>

<p>
The poor child was frightened, and ran crying to
me, when Sir Oliver, with his innate right feeling and
kindliness of heart, asked me to bring him down into
the cabin, which I did, where the little fellow soon
became quite at home, and began to amuse himself
with some books of plates, and little Chinese figures
that the commodore took out of a locker for his
entertainment.
</p>

<p>
I related the particulars of my interview with his
parents and kinsfolk on board the ship, which moved
the kind old man exceedingly; but dinner was now
announced, and Dicky was handed over to Lennox,
who had come on board in the novel capacity of
dry-nurse.  I could see the whole crew clustered on the
main-deck, in expectation of his coming out of the
cabin; and the moment he made his appearance,&mdash;"Lennox,
pass him forward."&mdash;"I say, Jack, Jack
Lennox, lend him to me, man."&mdash;"Oh! d&mdash;n my eyes,
man, do give us a spell of the piccaniny."&mdash;"No,
no&mdash;hand him to me first&mdash;here to me, man&mdash;I bespoke
him, Jack, before Bill, there," resounded on all hands;
and the two monkeys and hog in armour were as dust
in the balance compared with Dicky Phantom.  We
sat down to dinner.  Mr Lanyard, and old Sprawl,
along with one of the mates, were present, and every
thing went on very much as usual.
</p>

<p>
"We must endeavour," said Sir Oliver, "to find out
that poor little fellow's family and relations when we
get to England; but what are we to do with him until
we get there?"
</p>

<p>
I cheerfully offered to take care of him on board the
Midge.
</p>

<p>
"You are very good, Mr Brail&mdash;but in so small a
hooker it would be inconvenient, so I shall make shift
the best way I can here."
</p>

<p>
Lanyard laughed, and said, "That next to a round-robin
had been signed by the Midges, petitioning you
would let them have the boy for the cruise, sir, in
consequence of their having lost the ship's monkey and
parrot."  I noticed Sir Oliver's servant prick up his
ears at this; and that same evening, before we got
away from Gazelle, a deputation waited on Sprawl to
offer both monkeys and the kangaroo, and the hog in
armour, to the Midges, in fee simple, in exchange for
Dicky Phantom.  The commodore had recovered his
looks and spirits greatly since I last saw him, and in
the course of the evening gave us some of his old
stories, more than one of which I had certainly heard
before.  They were chiefly relating to the countries
on the borders of the Mediterranean, and the following
tickled me a good deal at the time:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver had been one of old Sir J. D&mdash;&mdash;'s
lieutenants on that station, and it was his watch on deck
on a certain forenoon&mdash;"a fine fresh breezy day, clear
and sunshiny, and the old T&mdash;&mdash; was cracking along
on the starboard tack, with the island of Malta broad
on the lee bow, ten miles distant, or thereabouts.  She
was going nine knots, as near as could be, and the
admiral was walking backwards and forwards with me
on the weather-side of the quarterdeck.  It happened
that the captain's servant was an inveterate stutterer,
although a steady good man, and we had not continued
our perambulations above a quarter of an hour, when
this functionary rushed up the ladder in a deuced
quandary, and thus addressed, or rather attempted to
address the admiral:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Sir&mdash;sir&mdash;sir&mdash;Jo&mdash;Jo&mdash;Jo'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'What does he mean?' said the admiral, startled
by the energy of the man's gestures.
</p>

<p>
"'Your pi&mdash;pi&mdash;pig.  Your wi&mdash;wi&mdash;wig,
over&mdash;over&mdash;over'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here the poor fellow got into convulsions, and
walloped his arms about like the sails of a wind-mill,
making signs that some <i>body</i> or <i>thing</i> was overboard.
The captain coming on deck at the moment, saw what
was going on&mdash;'Sing, you lubber, sing,' and straightway
he of the impediment gave tongue in a clear and
melodious pipe, as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'The admiral's pig is overboard, is overboard, is overboard,<br />
  His pig and his wig are overboard,<br />
  Heave-to, or they'll both be drown'd.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"'Man the fore-clew garnets,' sung out old
Blowhard&mdash;'back the main-topsail, Captain R&mdash;&mdash;, back
the main-topsail&mdash;lower away the jolly-boat.  Quick,
Captain R&mdash;&mdash;, quick.'
</p>

<p>
"Here the old flag-officer's own servant came up to
him, as he was straining his neck where he stood on
the aftermost carronade, to see, over the hammock-cloths,
what was becoming of the pig and the unfortunate scratch.
</p>

<p>
"'There, there they are&mdash;both are astern,' he sung
out.  'There's my poor wig bobbing at me.'  (The
origin of bob wig?)  'It will choke some dolphin, or
I am a Dutchman, before evening.  And the pig, oh,
my poor pig!'
</p>

<p>
"'Please you, Sir J&mdash;&mdash;,' chimed in the functionary,
'it is a false alarm.  That stuttering blockhead
has made a mistake; it is the master's wig, Sir J&mdash;&mdash;,
and the porker belongs to the ward-room.'
</p>

<p>
"'Fill the maintopsail again,' rapped out the
knight.  'Poor pig&mdash;poor pig&mdash;can't be helped&mdash;can't
be helped&mdash;pity the master should lose his scratch
though, <i>but it can't</i> be helped, Captain R&mdash;&mdash;, can't
be helped.  So fill away the maintopsail again,
Captain R&mdash;&mdash;.'
</p>

<p>
"Alas and alackaday, <i>both the pig and the wig were
drowned</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Mr Donovan being now well enough to resume his
duty, remained that evening in the frigate, but
Lanyard and I returned, towards nightfall, with my tiny
topman, to the felucca, and great was the buzz of joy
amongst the Midges at getting back Dicky Phantom.
</p>

<p>
We were sitting at breakfast on deck under the
awning, next morning, Donovan having returned for
his traps, and the frigate's boat was towing astern&mdash;Dicky
Phantom was part and portion of our society&mdash;the
carpenter having already got a little chair so
contrived, that when lashed to the leg of the table, he
could not fall out of it.
</p>

<p>
The frigate was about a mile to the northward of us,
looming like a seventy-four, as she glimmered through
the hot blue haze that hung over the horizon, and
circumscribed our view on all sides, for it was stark calm.
The sun shone down with true tropical intensity; the
heaving swell was like a sea of molten silver, and every
now and then a dolphin would leap close to us, while,
as from the side of a watery hill, a shower of flying-fish
would spring out and shoot across a liquid valley,
until they dropped like a discharge of grape into the
next billow.
</p>

<p>
Nothing nourishes one's grog-drinking propensities,
or spoils one's beauty so much, as the reflection of the
sun from the glass-like surface of the calm sea within
the tropics.  His direct rays are in some measure
warded off by your hat-brim; but were you even to
turn up your ugly phiz at him, and stare him in the
face, they would have comparatively no effect, to
the fierceness of their heat second-hand in this way.
Oh, the sickening effect of the afternoon's glare, thus
reflected, and flashed up into your face, under the snout
of your chapeau, which here, like a battery taken in
reverse, proves no defence, until your eyes are blinded,
and your cheeks routed and roasted, and your neb
peeled, like an ill-scraped radish, leaving the
underskin so tender, that breaking on the wheel is comfort
to blowing your nose.  Cold cream&mdash;cold cream!  Oh,
for a pot of it, ye gods!
</p>

<p>
I have before said, we were not, where we sat, much
above four feet out of the water, and several flying-fish
had come on board that morning; so just as I was
helping Dicky to a little water, to wash down the
soaked biscuit that, through Lennox's kindness, he
had been feeding on, dash&mdash;a very large one flew right
againt Dennis Donovan's cheek, and dropped walloping
and floundering into his plate.
</p>

<p>
"Blazes, what is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a beautiful leetle fis!" said the child.
</p>

<p>
But Dennis, honest man, did not recover his
equanimity during the whole meal.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after breakfast, as he was preparing to
go on board of the Gazelle, and to part company
regularly, one of the men, who was looking out astern,
sung out in a low tone, as if afraid the fish should
hear, "A shark, sir, close under the stern."  We gently
hauled the frigate's boat alongside, to be out of the
way, and, on looking over the tafferel, there was the
monster, sure enough, about three feet below the
surface of the clear green water, eyeing us with the greatest
composure.
</p>

<p>
As if noways daunted, but rather determined to have
a nearer and better view of us, he gradually floated up,
until his dorsal fin was a foot out of the water, and his
head but just covered by it.  We instantly got a hook
baited, and let down.  The fish was about twelve feet
long; and, as I leant over the low stern of the vessel,
when she sank on the fall of the swell, I could have
touched the monster's head with a handspike.  There
was something very exciting in being on terms of such
intimacy with a creature who would have thought it
capital sport to have nipped you in two.
</p>

<p>
He eyed the bait and the hook, and then drew back
about a yard from it, and ogled me again, as much as
to say,&mdash;"Not to be had so clumsily, Master Brail;
but if you would oblige me with one of your legs, now,
or even an arm, I would vastly prefer it to the piece
of rancid salt pork you offer me on that rusty piece of
crooked iron there."
</p>

<p>
Here again he reconnoitred the bait, and walloped
about all round it, as if laughing at us, and saying to
himself,&mdash;"No go, my boys."  He then looked up
with a languishing eye at little Dicky Phantom, whom
Lennox was now holding on the tafferel.  "Ah,"
again said sharkee to himself, I make no question,
"ah, <i>that's</i> the thing I want.  What a morsel <i>that</i>
would be!" and he made several rushes hither and
thither, as one has seen a dog do, before settling down
steadily on end, to look up at the morsel an urchin is
tantalizing him with.
</p>

<p>
At length, seeing I was so unaccommodating and
inexorable as not even to oblige him with a limb, and
that Dicky Phantom was altogether forbidden fruit, he
made an angry dart, and vanished below the counter.
</p>

<p>
"Poo, confound him, he can't be hungry," quoth Mr
Weevil the purser, as he hauled in the line, hand over
hand, until the bait was close under foot; when, just
as it was rising out of the water, the shark, finding
that it must be either salt junk or no fare, made a
sudden grab at the bait, gorged it&mdash;dashed off with it,
and, alack-a-daisy, <i>with the purser also</i>.  Dreaming
no harm, he had for a moment taken a turn of the
line round his left arm as he hauled in, which, by the
sudden jerk, <i>ran</i>; and if Lennox and old Drainings
had not caught him by the heels, he would have been
fairly overboard.  The fun now grew fast and furious,
for there was the hideous fish, walloping and floundering,
and surging about, within a fathom of the purser,
who was hanging over the stern, like a side of beef laid
in, at sailing, for sea stock; his head dip-dipping into
the water every now and then, as the vessel rose and
fell, while he struggled, and spluttered, and twisted,
in a vain attempt to get his arm loose; the shark all the
time back, backing like a restive horse, and dragging
and jerking about until I thought the purser's fin would
absolutely have been torn from his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
All this time the crew were like to explode with
laughter, while poor Weevil roared lustily,&mdash;"Haul
me in, for Heaven's sake, my good men, or he will
swallow me&mdash;haul"&mdash;&mdash;Here his head would sink into
the water, and the sentence end in a great coughing
and spluttering, until, just as he was on the point of
being suffocated, out his nob would be dragged again
by the pitching of the vessel, so as to enable him to
renew his shouts for succour.  At length the shark,
being a good deal exhausted, was brought close under
the stern, when I sent two bullets, from my
double-barrelled Manton, through his head, right between his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," quoth old Drainings the cook, "that has
settled him, or the devil is in it; so lend a hand,
Lennox,"&mdash;(the marine had hold of one of the purser's
legs, and the <i>artiste!</i> the other)&mdash;"so lend a
hand, Lennox, and, during the lull, let us bouse in Mr
Weevil.  Ho, yo, yo, yo, oh!"
</p>

<p>
The wounded shark had borne the loss of his brains
with great composure, but the instant he felt the
renewed drag at the pork in his maw, as if he had been
only stunned, he started off at a tangent as strong as
ever; and before you could say Jack Robinson, the
pursuer's starboard leg was whipped out of Jack
Lennox's clutches; but the one to port being in old
Drainings' iron claws, was held like grim death, for
he was a great ally of Weevil's.
</p>

<p>
"Don't for Heaven's sake, let me go, Mr Drainings,"
roared Weevil, as if cookey had been his last
shroud, "don't,"&mdash;splutter, splutter&mdash;"oh,"&mdash;cough,
cough.  The little vessel at this moment sended heavily,
giving a strange sort of swinging lurch or wallop,
as if shaking her sides with laughter, and again dipped
his head a foot under water.
</p>

<p>
As the unfortunate piscator rose this time with a jerk
to the surface, the shark, having had momentary scope
to sink, kept his own so resolutely, that <i>clip</i>, as a
climax to the fun, the old cook himself was torn from his
hold, and away <i>he</i> went next, still clinging to the
purser's leg, however, so that if his own had not been seized
by Lennox and myself, he would have been overboard
also.  I was now like to die with laughter.  I could
scarcely keep my hold; as for speaking, it was out of
the question, for the shark, and purser, and cook, like
a string of Brobdingnag sausages, were floundering in
the calm water, close under our counter, all linked
together, not quite "ladies' chain," by the way,
although, from the half-suffocated exclamations of two
of the links, it might not inaptly have been called,
"Chaine des <i>Dames</i>."  Oh, fie!  Benjie Brail.  However,
the matter was now getting serious.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Peak, that boathook there&mdash;quick, bring the
boathook."&mdash;Little Joe was no admirer of Weevil's,
and, as he made believe to hook him by the waistband
of the breeches, as he struggled in the water, he
contrived to dig the sharp point of the instrument into
his stern-frame more than once; and at length when
he did catch him, it was by nothing that would hold,
but by one of the pockets of his coat, which instantly
<i>gave</i>, and out flew into the water his snuff-box,
pocket-handkerchief, and a nondescript pouch of
sealskin, rolled up.
</p>

<p>
"Lord save us! dinna drown the spleuchan,"
exclaimed Lennox, as it dropped into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Hook him again," shouted Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord! captain, haul me in, haul me in, or I
must let go Mr Weevil's leg," sung out cookey.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, for Heaven's sake, do that thing, my dear
Mr Drainings," roared the purser.  Here Joey caught
him again with the boathook, by the cape of his coat;
and, with the assistance of two men, he had got him a
foot or two out of the water, when <i>screed</i>,&mdash;the cloth,
which was of no kindred to that which composed
Bailie Jarvie's skirts,&mdash;gave way, and down he plumped
again <i>souse</i>, and the splashing and struggling, and
cursing and coughing, and blowing of fish and men,
were renewed with twofold extravagance, until by a
fortunate dig the iron hook was finally passed through
the head-band of his nether garment, and the canvass
fortunately holding, we hauled him in, with Drainings
still sticking to him like grim Death, or a big sucker-fish.
It was a pity that such a delightful party should
be separated, so by slipping down a bowling knot over
the shark's head, and under his gills, we hoisted him
also in on deck, which he soon had all to himself
entirely; I really expected he would have stove it in
with the lashing of his tail.  We hammered him on
the head until we had crushed it to mummy; but, like
many other strange fish, he appeared to get on as well
without brains as with.  In fine, he would have taken
the ship from us out and out, had not old Shavings
watched his opportunity, and nicked him on the tail
with his hatchet, thereby severing his spine, when a
complete paralysis instantly took place, and he lay still;
but even an hour after he was disembowelled, he
writhed about the deck like an eel.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of sharks, I must <i>taigle</i> you here with
another story, which, however <i>lee-like</i>, did actually
occur, as the records of the Jamaica Admiralty Court
fully prove.  But let Dennis Donovan tell it in his
own words.
</p>

<p>
"We were cruising off Cape Tiburoon, to take our
chance of any of the French outward-bound that might
have preferred to make the passage to Port-au-Prince
by the southward of St Domingo.  It might have been
five in the afternoon,&mdash;I was a little middy then, and
had dined with the captain that day; a fine fresh
forenoon we had had of it,&mdash;but the devil a thing was
there in sight, not even a small white speck of a sail
slipping along shore apparently sailing in the white
surf, and standing off full and boldly, as the painters
say, from the dark background of bushes fringing the
white beach."
</p>

<p>
"But why take the pains to describe <i>so well</i> what
<i>was not there</i>, Dennis?"
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind, but let me get along; you can
pocket the description, Benjie, and keep it for your
own use.
</p>

<p>
"I had just swallowed what I had sense enough to
know was considered as my last glass of wine, and had
come on deck, when, looking out to leeward, where the
setting sun was casting a blinding wake on the blue
waters that blazed up in our faces, roasting our skin
into the colour of scarlet, I thought I saw a dark
object on the very verge of the horizon.  From the
afternoon having come on thick, this had not been noticed
before; but just as I had made the discovery, the
lookout man at the masthead hailed, 'a strange sail, abeam
of us to leeward.'
</p>

<p>
"'Thank you for nothing,' responded the crusty
lieutenant; 'you blind beetle you, is it <i>now</i> you see
it?  Why, we can see under her topsails from the deck
here.'
</p>

<p>
"'May be, sir,' answered the man, 'but the weather
has been thick as buttermilk down to leeward until
this moment.'
</p>

<p>
"'All hands make sail,' instantly followed, and in
five minutes we ran off the wind, with every rag set
that we could spread.  A stern chase is proverbially
a long chase, and although our friend a-head set
nothing as we neared him that he had not abroad
before, the next morning broke, and we were still three
miles astern of him: Jamaica being in sight to
leeward.  As the sun rose, the breeze freshened, and
before noon we had to hand the royals, and stand by
the studding-sail haulyards.  The fiery sea-breeze that
struck us, presently quelled the courage of the chase,
for he had to take in his kites also, with the loss of
his foretopmast-studding-sail; and as we carried the
breeze down with us, we were presently alongside,
and I was sent on board in the boat.
</p>

<p>
"I touched my hat to the master, 'What brig, if
you please?'
</p>

<p>
"'The Stormy Peterel, of, and from St John's,
New Brunswick.'
</p>

<p>
"'Whither bound?'
</p>

<p>
"'To Kingston, Jamaica, with a cargo of flour
and <i>notions</i>, consigned to Macaa, Walker, and Co.'
</p>

<p>
"All very pat, thought I&mdash;no hesitation here.  'I
will look at your papers, if you please,' and I
unceremoniously stepped down the companion ladder, and
entered the cabin.  The master of the brig followed
me, entering with a good deal of swagger in his
bearing, and slammed himself down on the locker with
his hat on.  I was a little nettled at this, and again
took a steady look at my gentleman; but to make
evident the cause why my suspicions were excited, be
it known, that at the time I write of, the old
navigation laws were in full operation; and no American,
or other foreign vessel, was allowed to trade with our
colonies; every thing imported having to be carried
in British bottoms; so that numberless tricks were
frequently put in practice by neutrals when the colonial
markets were favourable, to cloak the real character of
their vessels,&mdash;amongst others, that of simulating
English papers was very frequent.  To return, I looked
at our friend again.  He was tall, sallow, and
Yankee-looking in hull, spars, and rig, and his accent smelt of
peach brandy&mdash;strong of the Chesapeake.  He was
dressed in faded nankeen trowsers, rusty black coat and
waiscoat, all very threadbare, the coat sleeves scarcely
reaching below the elbows.  He wore a broad-brimmed
white hat, with a rumpled and spray-washed black or
rather brown crape twisted round it, but no neckcloth, his
shirt collar, which was cut very high, being open in
front, disclosing his long scraggy red neck, with a
lump in his throat as if he had swallowed a grape shot,
that had stuck half way down.  His large ill-washed
frill was also open, showing his sunburnt chest, covered
with a fell of shaggy red hair, as thick as a fox-cover,
and his face was burned red by exposure to the sun,
the skin peeling off in small pieces like the film of an
egg, here and there.  His features were very strongly
marked and coarse, one side of his mouth drooping
more than the other, from which he kept swabbing
the stream of tobacco juice with the back of his hand.
He had little fierce grey eyes, the white being much
bloodshot, and his nose was long and sharp, as near as
might be of the shape and colour of a crab's claw, with
a blue peeled point.  But the most curious part of
the animal was the upperworks&mdash;the forehead being
very broad immediately above his eyes, which were
shaded by enormous shaggy sandy-white eyebrows,
like pig's bristles, it then tapered away into a cone at
the crown of his head, like the hat in vogue amongst
the Roundheads in old Noll's time.  His red whiskers
grew in two tufts low down on his jowls and all under
his chin, and he kept spitting most abominably, and
twitching the right cheek, and quivering the right
eyelid, while he looked at you, in a nervous, and to
me exceedingly disagreeable manner.  He had, in fine,
nothing of the sailor whatever in his appearance&mdash;being
more like a half-pay Methodist parson.
</p>

<p>
"'There be my papers, sir,' said this enticing
person, tossing down a parcel of by no means dirty
manuscripts.  The register especially, as well as the
manifest, seemed surprisingly clean, and the former,
instead of being carefully enclosed in a tin box, as
customary in merchant vessels, was wrapped up in
brown paper.  I opened the manifest, and glanced at
a bundle of copies of bills of lading, called ship's
blanks.  The cargo answered his description, and the
bills of lading seemed to correspond with the manifest.
I then lifted the register, and by it perceived that the
vessel purported to be two years old, yet the document,
in place of being torn and chafed at the foldings,
and dirty, greasy, and defaced, was quite sound.&mdash;When
I opened it, after unfolding the brown paper in
which it was wrapped, and threw it on the table, it
absolutely and truly opened of itself, and lay flat on
the table, as if unused to the rumples and creases&mdash;to
the no small surprise of Jonathan himself I could
perceive&mdash;thus seeming to say, 'Take a look at me,
Master Donovan, I am worth the perusal, perhaps.'&mdash;'Ha,
ha,' thought I, 'my fine fellow, the creases
in that register are very fresh, I guess&mdash;it has not
been quite two years folded, or I never saw the Liffey;'
but I said never a word aloud, to the apparent great
comfort of the skipper, who, I could see, sat on thorns,
while I was overhauling the papers&mdash;for, thinks I, if
he sees into me, he will haul his wind, and not come
to an entry at Kingston at all, and on the high seas I
cannot touch him; but then, again, as the devil would
have it, were we even to decoy him into port, another
man-of-war may nab him before us.  My game, said
I to myself, is to lull his suspicions as well as I can;
and having done so, I returned to the frigate, and we
ran down to Port Royal very lovingly together.
</p>

<p>
"They had caught a shark during my absence, and
found a tin case, loaded with a dozen musket balls,
with a ship's manifest and register in it, in his maw.
I lost no time in repairing to the cabin, and communicating
to the captain my suspicions that the brig was
an American, sailing under false papers; recommending
that the frigate should stick close and seize him
whenever he had passed the Rubicon by reporting at the
fort at Port Royal.  He agreed to all my suggestions;
and after determining that I was to board and seize the
vessel before others could have an opportunity of doing
so, ordered in dinner, and laughing, threw the bright
white iron case to me that had been cut out of the maw
of the shark.
</p>

<p>
"I opened it, and, to my surprise, found that,
according to the best of my recollection, the manuscript
copy of the manifest answered word for word, nail for
nail, with the one I had seen&mdash;the measurement of
the Yankee brig Alconda being identically the same,
out and out, with that of the 'Stormy Peterel of St
John's, New Brunswick.'
</p>

<p>
"Having communicated the coincidence to the
captain, he desired me to keep my own counsel, which I
did.  The vessel was seized and libelled in the
Vice-Admiralty Court, to the great apparent surprise of
Captain Shad of the Stormy Peterel, I guess.  The day of
trial arrived; we were all in court, and so were the
crew and captain of the detained vessel.  Our
counsel, learned in the law, made his speech, and
produced his witnesses.  He of the adverse faction replied,
and produced his, and cross-questioned ours, and pretty
considerable perjuries were flying about; and although
the suspicion was strong against the Stormy Peterel,
still she was on the point of flying away and
weathering us all, when the lawyer retained by the
merchantman said sneeringly across the table to our advocate,
'Sorry must go for damages against your client; I
hope you have your recognisances and bail-bond ready.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are very obliging, brother Grab,' said our
friend, calmly&mdash;then to the bench, 'may it please your
honour, I am now in a position to save you farther
trouble, by proving, on the most undeniable evidence,
by a most disinterested witness, that the vessel in court,
purporting to be "the Stormy Peterel of St John's,
New Brunswick"'&mdash;here Jonathan's jaw fell&mdash;'is
neither more nor less'&mdash;the Yankee's eyes seemed like
to start from their sockets&mdash;'than the American brig
Alconda, off and from New York.'
</p>

<p>
"'Who the hell has peached?' screamed the
Yankee, looking round fiercely among his own men,
and utterly shoved off his balance!
</p>

<p>
"'Silence,' sang out the crier.
</p>

<p>
"'The hand of heaven is in this iniquitous matter,
please your honour.'  Here he produced the tin box, and
took out the Alconda's manifest and register, and
confronting them with the forged papers belonging to the
Stormy Peterel, the trick was instantly proved, and the
vessel condemned&mdash;Jonathan, as he swung out of court,
exclaiming, amidst showers of tobacco juice, 'Pretty
considerably damned and con-<i>damned</i>, and all by a
bloody sharkfish.  If this ben't, by G&mdash;, the most
active and unnatural piece of cruelty&mdash;may I be physicked
all my natural days with hot oil and fish-hooks!'"
</p>

<p>
So far, so true; but Dennis, honest man, superadded
a few flourishes of his own, one of which was, that
the spine of the shark was extracted, and preserved
in the captain's cabin, hung up to the roof; and that
one of the quartermasters, "a most religious
charackter," could notice certain vibrations and twistings
of the vertebrae, whenever any vessel with false papers
was in the vicinity&mdash;even when she could not be seen
from the masthead.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it must have been a divining rod&mdash;a second
rod of Moses," said I, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"And you have said it with your own beautiful
mug, Benjie Brail," quoth Dennis Donovan.
</p>

<p>
"Gammon," said I Benjie.

CHAPTER XI.

JAMBE DE BOIS.

<p>
"Now, Master Abraham, if you try that trick again,
I will make free with this mopstick, and break your
head.  Why, look here, cook, if he has not been
teaching the child to chew tobacco!  I suppose they will
be asking Mr Weevil to serve him out his allowance
of grog next."
</p>

<p>
It was Lennox who had spoken.  Lanyard rung
the bell.  "What's the matter now, steward?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, they are massacring that poor little
fellow, and teaching him all manner of abominations.
But it's all in kindness, sir; so one really cannot be
so angry with them, as"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Never mind then, get breakfast.  What sort of
morning is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite calm, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And the frigate?"
</p>

<p>
"About a mile to the northward of us, sir.  The
boat that was sent on board with Mr Donovan this
morning, and to bring hay for the sheep, is now
coming back again, sir."
</p>

<p>
Presently I heard the splash of the oars, then the
noise and rumble of their being laid in; and the crew
having got on board, she was hoisted up.  By this time I
was on deck; it was about seven o'clock in the morning,
and, as the steward had reported, quite calm.  "Heigh,
ho! another roasting day, Mr Marline," said I, as I
swept the horizon with the glass, round every part of
which the junction of sea and sky was obliterated by
a hot quivering blue haze, through which the
frigate twinkled, her white streak glimmering like a
ribbon streaming in the wind, and her hull trembling,
as it were, in every atom: while her masts appeared
to twist like snakes, the small wavy motion beginning
at the deck, and flowing upwards towards the mastheads.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the midshipman, "every appearance
of a broiling day, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Well, get the awning up, as quick as you can,"
said the lieutenant, who had followed me.  And I set
myself to play with Dicky Phantom, until breakfast
was ready.
</p>

<p>
We ate our meal on deck; after it was ended I
went below, and took a book to while away the time
in the least wearisome manner possible; but being a dull
dog I had got hold of, I soon tired; and, as I stretched
myself on the locker, I saw Lennox, in his small
pantry of a place behind the companion ladder, busy
writing.  When I first noticed him, he seemed very
serious and melancholy.  I could see a tear stand in
his eye now and then, and he would blow his nose in
a very pathetic and interesting manner; but as he
went on, he once or twice laid down his pen, and
laughed to himself, rubbing his hands in ecstasy.  He
again plied his task for some time quietly, until the
laughing fit once more overtook him, when he threw
himself back on the small <i>settle</i> or block on which he
sat, with such vehemence, that he cracked the back of
his skull against the ladder very sharply, and uttered
an involuntary "Oh!"  In the confusion which this
lapse threw him into, he upset the ink on his paper.
Out of pure wickedness, I called out, "Lennox!"
</p>

<p>
"Coming, sir,"&mdash;while he bustled to gather up the
ink, a precious article on board, with his pen, and to
shovel it into the bottle again; but he did not come
great speed this way, so he next tried a tea-spoon.
</p>

<p>
"Lennox!"
</p>

<p>
"Coming, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Coming? why, do come, man, and give me a
glass of water, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"This instant, sir&mdash;beg pardon, sir&mdash;but&mdash;but"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
By this he had got his papers stowed away, and
made his appearance with his trowsers covered with
ink.  I looked at him; he was blushing to the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what <i>have</i> you been after?  You have
spilled all my ink, I see&mdash;writing love-letters, I
suppose?"&mdash;In his bashfulness he here drew his hand
across his face, and thereby transferred a good dash of
the "best Japan" to his nose and cheeks, the effect
of which was so absurd that I could not help laughing
outright.&mdash;"You are an author, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
He blushed still deeper, and seeing I waited for an
answer, rapped out, "I am, sir, in a small way."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!" said I, rather surprised that I should
have hit the right nail on the head thus unexpectedly;
"and pray, what works have you produced&mdash;what
walk in literature have you especially followed out?"
</p>

<p>
"The novel line, lately, sir, but"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The novel line!  A <i>novel</i> line, certainly, for a
corporal of marines," said I, interrupting him rather
sneeringly.&mdash;"Pray, who and what were you before
you joined Gazelle, Lennox; that is, if you have no
objections to tell?"
</p>

<p>
He did not make me a direct answer.
</p>

<p>
"You have been very kind to me, sir," said the
poor fellow, "and have more than once stood my
friend, when, Heaven knows, I was desolate enough;
indeed, if it had not been for you, Mr Brail, I would
have gone overboard, some dark night, with a cold
shot at my feet; for the Devil, who is always busy
with desperate men, has been near getting the upper
hand aftener than I will stay the noo to tell.  But as
I was saying,"&mdash;and here a large tear rolled down his
face, through ink and all,&mdash;"I am bound to you, sir,
and if you have any desire to know who I am, or what
I have been, I am ready to tell you."
</p>

<p>
I was a little moved at this, as I had no idea that
any little service I had rendered the poor fellow should
have been so gratefully remembered.  "Why,
Lennox, I have done no more to you, nor for you, than
I hope every right-hearted man would have done to an
inferior; but I will not deny that I have such a desire."
</p>

<p>
He put into my hands a dirty roll of paper.
</p>

<p>
"Your honour has been very patient with me; but
I hope I know my place better than to weary you with
a long story; so, referring you to the manuscript,
which you may read or not as you please, I will, with
your permission&mdash;go and kill the pig, and then help the
cook to scrape potatoes in the galley."
</p>

<p>
He withdrew&mdash;I looked after him, and then took a
short turn on deck, where every thing was going on
much as usual; I then returned to the cabin, and
having stretched myself along the locker, and seen the
windsail comfortably drawing down the small skylight?
I unrolled the manuscript, which was entitled
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "THE SORROWS OF SAUNDERS SKELP."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Poor Dominie Skelp! his sorrows were amusing
enough, here and there, melancholy as his story was
in the main.  Some parts of the narrative were powerful,
although unequally written, as if the mind of the
writer had originally been calm and clear as a polished
mirror, until shattered by the rude blows of misfortune
into dust and rubbish, but still intermingled here and
there with bright and sparkling fragments.  His
father, a respectable tradesman in a small country town,
had cramped himself in every way to give his son a
good education, and he had actually attained the
barren dignity of a licentiate in the Scottish Kirk.  After
this he became the schoolmaster of the parish, and
was even in the habit of occasionally preaching for
Mr Bland, the clergyman, or minister thereof, as he
called him.  At length he fell in love with a beautiful
and innocent girl; after which it was all the old story,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The course of true love never did run smooth."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And the loves of Saunders Skelp and Jessy Miller were
no exception to the rule; the young laird, Mr Adderfang,
having seduced the girl, and contrived, by a very
mean and cruel <i>ruse</i>, not only to blast the happiness
of both, but even to cast the blame of the transaction
on the young probationer for a season.  "But let the
dominie tell his own story, Master Benjie."
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart, my boy.  So here it is; mind
it don't try your patience, however."

  But grown like turnips, man had never sinned.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"My great-grandfather, grandfather, and immediate
progenitor, were all <i>ministers' men</i> in the landward
parish of Lincumdodie.
</p>

<p>
"My father had added to his more immediate
vocation, that of a shoemaker; and being a good
tradesman, we were the easiest in our circumstances of any
family in the village, until my stepmother suddenly
took to drinking, and thereby nearly broke my father
down in mind, body, and estate.
</p>

<p>
"I can call it nothing else but a disease; for hitherto
she had always been a discreet body, and a kind to
me, considering I was an only bairn, and therefore sure
to be fashious, and nane of her ain flesh and blood forby.
</p>

<p>
"My father focht lang with her, strapping her
respectably at ae time, and fleeching and praying with
her at anither; syne he would get the minister himsell
to speak till her, but a' wad not do, for the puir body
just grat and listened, and gat fou again; and grat and
listened and gat fou, until at length the auld man
crossed his arms in downricht despair, <i>and let her at it</i>.
</p>

<p>
"The issue wasna long in doubt, for she was fairly
<i>speerited</i> awa between and that day three months.
</p>

<p>
"Young as I was, my surprise was great, and so
was that of the haill village, at the way my father took
on when she died.  'She was ill to hersell, and no that
guid till you, Saunders,' said the minister to him one
day, by way of comforting him.  'And I can scrimp
deny that same, minister, but for mony a day she was
a leal and gude wife to me, before she fell away intil
that evil propensity; and although it whiles surprises
me mysell that I should miss an auld drucken wife sae
muckle, yet lang custom, minister, makes ane even
miss the very middenstead before the door, ye ken; at
ony rate, I canna think o' her just yet, without a
fullness at my heart, that I confess I am a wee bit
ashamed o'."
</p>

<p>
"When the steek in my father's purse, let down by
my mother's spiritual propensities, was taken up once
more by her death, we again began to float up into
respectability and comparative riches; so that we
gradually resumed the status in the small village
from which we had declined.
</p>

<p>
"I was at this time about twelve years of age, and
my father sent me back to the school which my
mother had drank me out of; and in the course of three
years, I believe I may with a safe conscience say, that
I knew as much as the master himself did; of whom
the young laird, Mr Adderfang, used to say,&mdash;'He
would be a clever chiel wha kenn'd <i>all the master
didna</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"About this time, old Durie Squake, the precentor,
met with an accident which gave me temporary
promotion in the kirk; for, coming into it one dark
forenoon in the winter-time, after having oiled his
chanter with a drap drink, he did not notice that the
door of his wee poopit had been altered, so as to swing
the contrary way to what it did before; and as it stood
wide open, fronting him edgeways, it was as clean and
invisible as if it had been the blade of a knife; so that
although the blind body had as usual his twa paws
extended and stuck out before him, one holding his Bible
and the other his pitchpipe, he ran smack up against
the edge, clipping the leaf of the door with an
outspread arm on each side of it, and thereby received
such a <i>devel</i>, that his nose was bashed, and the sneck
sank into his forehead, as if he had been struck with a
butcher's hatchet.  Down fell auld Durie Squake, with
a grunt and a squelch, on his back.  'Losh preserve
me!  I aye kenned I had a lang nose, but surely it's
langer this blessed Sabbath than common!'
</p>

<p>
"He was helped up and hame by two o' the elders,
and being a thick-skulled creature, he was soon
repaired by the farrier in the village, so as to be maist as
gude as new, no being muckle worth at his best, and
he was at his wark again in no time; but although his
skull was sound, his voice was a wee cracked for ever
after; and now the question came, what was to be
done for a precentor that blessed day?  A neighbouring
minister, the excellent Mr Clour, of the parish of
Thistledoup, was to preach, and by this time in the
poopit, and he could sing none, I kenned; as for auld
Mr Bland, our ain pastor, he was as empty of music
as a toom bagpipe; so baith the ministers and their
hearers sat glowering at each other for a guid space,
until the uproar was over, and the bum had subsided,
and I was just wondering what was to be done, when
I found something kittle-kittling the crown of my head.
I sat, it must be known, in a wee bit back jam of a
pew, just before the minister's seat, and my father
aside me.  I looked round&mdash;it was the auld
minister&mdash;'Saunders,' says he, 'your father tells me ye can
sing fine&mdash;gae awa wi' ye, my bonny man, into the
precentor's seat.'  I was in an awful taking; the blood
rushed to my face, and the sweat dropped from the
point of my nose; nevertheless, I screwed up my courage,
and, like a callant louping into the water to bathe
in a cauld day, I dashed into the Psalm with great bir
and success; but the speed I came puffed up my
vanity until it burst, and I had a sair downcome that
day.  For finding that the precentor line was no sae
difficult as I expected, I thought I would shine a bit,
and at a solemn pause in the music aff I went, up and
away, intil some fine tirlie-wirlies, which I could not
cannily get out of again.  By and by, the congregation
dropped off one by one, as I ascended, until I was
left alone in my glory.  I started 'even at the sound
myself had made,' and looked up to the roof, at the
auld carved wark, above what had been the altar-piece
when the Catholics had the kirk, singing all the
while&mdash;but a nervous thought came over me, and suddenly
I felt as if I had got screwed in amongst the roses and
ornaments of the auld cornice, without the power of
extricating myself; and how to get home again into
the <i>Bangor</i>, that I had left so recklessly, I could not
divine.  At length, as my variations were nearly
exhausted, Willie Johnston's auld colley, Snap,
deliberately walked up the aisle, and cocking himself on end,
raised his voice and joined in chorus.  This speedily
brought me to a stand-still, for Balaam could not have
been more amazed when his ass spoke than I was;
besides, I saw the folk were all laughing, until some
one of them took advantage of the pause to skirl up
the original tune once more, and faith but I was glad
to join them.
</p>

<p>
"It was the fashion in our parish, at this time of
the year, to give two sermons at one sitting, but auld
Mr Clour had only brought one, and our ain minister
being as hoarse as a raven, there was nothing for it
but that Mr Clour should split his in two.  Indeed, I
heard him say, as they walked into the kirkyard
together&mdash;'Well, friend Bland, if I maun preach twa
sermons, while I hae only yin in my pouch, and nane
in my head, they must just be of the shortest, for I
can manage no other way than by halving it; however,
I'll gie them a gude bit screed of a psalm to
sough awa at after the first half, and that will help us
'ayont the twall,' as Burns says, before we begin to
the second.
</p>

<p>
"The first sermon passed over, and when he gave
out the Psalm that was to be the resting-place, the
half-way house between the wings of his discourse,
what was my dismay, to find that he, with all the
coolness in life, read out six long verses!  My mouth
was dry enough, and my throat husky enough with my
previous discomfiture, Heaven knows; but I whistled
away until I got to the line about 'a dry parched
land, wherein no waters be,' when my voice fairly
failed me a'thegither.  I made a desperate struggle,
but there was nae mair sound in me than in a
clarionet without the reed, or a child's bawbee whistle
blawn dumb on the first day of the fair.  So I waited
for a while, and again set to, but my screech was this
time a mixture of the cry of the corncraik and the
hissing of a goose; besides, I had lost the tune, and nane
of the congregation could find it, so I squeeled and
sweltered about, until the haill kirk and pews, and the folk
in them, danced before my eyes, and I could not tell
whether I was on my head or my heels.  At length I
croaked out, '<i>Vox faucibus hæsit, domine&mdash;Vox
faucibus hæsit</i>.  As sure's death, I can sing nane until
somebody gives me a drink of water.'  At this
moment I felt a slap on the cheek, which made me start
and turn round, and there was the auld minister leaning
ower the front of his pulpit, and girning at me like
Auld Nick himsell.  'Deevil's in the callant; has he
lost the <i>fang</i>[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>] already, wi' skirling up the Psalm but for
yae half hour?'  This drave me demented altogether,
so making a rush from the precentor's desk, I stumbled
down into my father's seat, who was lying with his
head on his blue bonnet, peching and perspiring with
utter shame and vexation.  <i>I never tried the
precentor line again</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Mv father's circumstances continued to improve,
and at last he found himself in a condition to send me
to Edinburgh itsell, to study for the kirk; and there I
continued for three years more, during session time;&mdash;after
which I returned home a licentiate of the Church
of Scotland no less, but with the immediate purpose of
succeeding the old schoolmaster of Lincomdodie, who
had about this period been gathered to his fathers.
</p>

<p>
"When I arrived, a proud man was my father of me
and my acquirements; and from that time forth, he
had morning and evening service every day in his
family&mdash;a thing he never had before, except on Sunday.
</p>

<p>
"And, oh! there was one that welcomed me back,
with a smile and a tear, and a trembling of the tongue,
and a heaving of her beautiful bosom, that was dearer,
far dearer to me than father or friends, although I
had a warm heart for them too.  It was Jessy Miller,
the only daughter of Rob Miller the carrier's widow,
a tall fair-skinned lassie, with raven locks, and dark
hazel eyes, and a face and figure with which none of
the village girls could compare.
</p>

<p>
"'Ye are welcome home again, Saunders&mdash;heartily
welcome; and you'll be glad to hear that the young
leddies at the hall&mdash;the laird's sisters, ye ken&mdash;have been
very kind to me and my mother baith, and that I go
up there every day to work for them; and they have
made me many a handsome present, as you see,
Saunders, and many a good book have they sent me; and
the young laird, Mr Adderfang, has come hame, ye
will have heard,'&mdash;I started, for I had not heard
it,&mdash;'and he is really very civil to us also.'  We were
speaking in a little bit green, at the western-most end
of the village.  There was a clump of horse chestnuts
behind us, through which the breeze was rushing with
a rustling sough, but it was neither strong enough nor
loud enough to drown the buzzing, or rather moaning
noise of the numberless bees that were gathering honey
from its blossoms, for it was in June; or the rushing
murmur of the clear sparkling burnie, that wimpled
past at our feet, with a bit crazy wooden brig across
it, beyond which a field of hay, ready for the scythe,
was waving in the breeze, with the shadows of the
shreds of summer clouds sailing along its green
undulations, as they racked across the face of the sun.
</p>

<p>
"At the moment when the mention of the young
laird's name by Jessy Miller, for he was known to be
a wild graceless slip, had sent the blood back to my
heart with a chill&mdash;a larger cloud than any that had
gone before threw its black shadow over where we sat,
while all around was blithe breeze and merry sunshine.
It appeared to linger&mdash;I took Jessy's hand, and pointed
upwards.  I thought she shrank, and that her fingers
were cold and clammy.  She tried to smile, but it
ended in a faint hysterical laugh, as she said,&mdash;'Saunders,
man, ye're again at your vagaries, and omens,
and nonsense; what for do ye look that gate at me, man?'
</p>

<p>
"'I canna help it, Jessy&mdash;no, for the soul of me,
I cannot&mdash;why does the heaven frown on you and me
only, when it smiles on all things beside?'
</p>

<p>
"'Hoot, it's but a summer cloud, and ye're a fule;
and there&mdash;there it's gane, ye see&mdash;there, see if it
hasna sailed away over the breezy hay field, beyond the
dyke there&mdash;come and help me ower it, man&mdash;come,'&mdash;and
once more I looked in her bright eyes undoubtingly,
and as I lifted her over the grey stones, I pressed
her to my heart, in the blessed belief and consciousness
that she was my ain Jessy Miller still.
</p>

<p>
"All the summer I officiated as helper to the
excellent Mr Bland, our parish minister&mdash;his nephew, who
was appointed to fill the situation permanently, being
still on the continent as tutor in a nobleman's family,
nor did he return until the autumn.
</p>

<p>
"Although I never expected to have a kirk of my
own, yet preaching was at this time a pleasure to
me&mdash;for my intellect was strong and clear, health good,
and spirits buoyant; my heart being at ease, and Jessy
Miller loving and faithful.
</p>

<p>
"And was it not a proud thing for a parritch-fed
laddie like me, to get the argument a' to mysell for a
hail forenoon, and to lay down the law to all the
gentry of the country, and maybe a lord among them;
and to gie them their kail through the reek, and cry
'anathema maranatha' against the vices of the rich&mdash;the
temptations whereto, if the truth maun be told,
I never kenned; while nane o' them dared so much
as open his mouth to reply to me?
</p>

<p>
"But I had ae redeeming virtue in their eyes, for,
although whiles dogmatic, I was never so downright
indiscreet as to inflict lang sermons on them&mdash;a
thing great folk canna thole&mdash;a half-hour till the
preachment, and a quarter till the prayer, being my
maximum; never forgetting, that a good practical
sermon should be like a jigot o' wee blackfaced Highland
mutton, short in the shank, and pithy, and nutritious,
which every body can digest something o', frae the
fistling restless callant, wi' a clue in his breeks, till
the auld staid elder, wha hears ye oot as steadily&mdash;teuch
as ben-leather though you may be&mdash;as if his tail were
Tam Clink's anvil.  So, putting the shortness o' the
screed against the bitterness o' the flyte, my popularity
on the whole greatly increased.&mdash;Thus mollified by
success, I grew sae bland and gentle in my disposition,
that I could never even skelp ony o' my wee scholars
without a tear in my eye; so that I verily believe if I
could have shoved the dull creatures on by applying
the tause to my ain&mdash;loof instead of theirs, I would
have willingly done so.
</p>

<p>
"But soon a wee bit cloud cam o'er me; for I began
about this time to be sair fashed with a great
income."
</p>

<p>
[I laid down the manuscript&mdash;"sair fashed with an
income&mdash;I say, Lennox"&mdash;I saw the marine in his
steward-room at the moment&mdash;"Why, Lennox,
construe me this, if you please&mdash;'sair fashed with an
income,'&mdash;that is more than ever I have been, if
I take you up rightly; but explain, if you
please&mdash;was your income so <i>very</i> great?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir, it was large enough to lame me for
six months!"
</p>

<p>
I stared&mdash;"An income so large that it lamed you
for six months&mdash;oh, you lived high&mdash;gout, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Na, na, sir&mdash;I had never any title to gout, nor
any of my forbears; but it was not the size of the
tumor that was the worst of it; for it contracted the
sinews and muscles of my left leg to such a degree,
that, after I had hobbled on crutches for six weeks,
I was at last fairly driven to stump it on a stick leg,
although, Heaven be thanked, I recovered entirely in
a year's time."
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow saw I was laughing; and apparently
uncertain as to whether I comprehended him or not,
he said&mdash;"An income is a tumour, sir; and mine
was a very bad ane."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see, I see; but tell me this, Lennox&mdash;You
speak very good English; and, from all I can hear, you
write it correctly&mdash;how came you, therefore, to have
indited your sorrows in your north country Doric?"
</p>

<p>
"Mair graphic, sir&mdash;I had an eye to publish, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now, I understand&mdash;thank you"&mdash;and I resumed
my study of the manuscript.]
</p>

<p>
"But I had my ain misgivings that Jessy would flee
aff frae me, after all, now that I was a lameter, and I
watched my opportunity to ask her frankly and fairly,
'whether we were to hold to our plighted troth, that
we should be man and wife whenever I had laid by an
hundred pounds from the school (I had already fifty),
or that the calamity which had come over me'&mdash;&mdash;I
could scarcely speak here, for something rose up in
my full breast, like a cork in a bottle that you are
filling with water, and stuck in my thrapple like to
choke me&mdash;; or that the calamity that had come over
me, was to snap our vows in twain&mdash;and, Jessy Miller,
I here declare, in the presence of our Maker, if it has
wrought such change in you, I release you
freely&mdash;freely&mdash;although it should break my heart, I release
you.'
</p>

<p>
"The poor girl's hand, as I spoke, grew colder and
colder, and her cheek paler and paler, until she fairly
sank on her knees on the auld grey moss-grown
stone that covered the muirland grave of the
Covenanters, situated about a mile from Lincomdodie, where
we happened to be at the time.  It was now the
gloaming the setting sun was flaming up in the red west,
and his last ray fell on the beautifully rounded form of
the fair lassie, and sparkled on the tear that stole down
her cheek, as she held up one hand to Heaven, and
grasped mine with the other.
</p>

<p>
"'Saunders Skelp, wi' ae leg or twa, or without a
leg of ony kind&mdash;if ever I prove faithless to you&mdash;may'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Hillo, Dominie&mdash;Dominie Skelp&mdash;you're a nice
young man, I <i>don't</i> know.'
</p>

<p>
"I started&mdash;Jessy shrieked, and rising, threw herself
into my arms&mdash;and as I turned round, who should be
ascending the hill, and now within a few yards of us,
but the young laird himself&mdash;as handsome and buirdly
a chiel as you would see in ten thousand!
</p>

<p>
"'Did that cloud come ower us at the side of the
hay-field that day for naething, Jessy?'  She could
not answer me.  The sun set, and one or two heavy
drops of rain fell, and the lift darkened&mdash;ay, and
something darker and drearier stole across my brain than
the shadows which now began to settle down on the
fair face of external nature.  My heart fluttered for
a moment, then made long irregular throbs, and finally
I became dizzy and faint, and almost fell to the ground
with Jessy in my arms.  'Was I, in very truth, in
the presence of an evil spirit?' said I to myself.
</p>

<p>
"'Why,' said the young gentleman, 'what has
come over you, Saunders?  I won't tell, man&mdash;so
keep your own secret, and nobody will be a whit the
wiser.'
</p>

<p>
"'Secret, sir!' said I, deeply stung; 'secret&mdash;I
have nane, sir&mdash;nane&mdash;that I love the lassie, the haill
parish kens, and I am not ashamed of it; but if
you&mdash;ay, you, sir, or <i>any</i> man, dares'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Heyday&mdash;dares!  What do you mean by that,
Master Skelp?&mdash;Dares!'
</p>

<p>
"My recollection and self-possession returned at
this moment.
</p>

<p>
"'I beg pardon, sir; I have been taken by
surprise, and in my anxiety to vindicate Jessy from all
suspicion, I have been very uncivil to you.  I am sorry
for it.'
</p>

<p>
"The abjectness of this apology caused me to blush
to the eyes, but it was made, as I thought, to serve
my heart-dear girl, and gulping down my chagrin and
wounded pride, I turned to go away.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, well, Dominie, I forgive you, man, and I
<i>believe</i> there is nothing wrong between you two after
all.  I only spoke in jest, man, and am in turn sorry
to have given you pain; so gie's your hand&mdash;there&mdash;and
I must have a kiss from Miss Miller, the darling,
or I never shall believe that you have both really and
truly forgiven me.'
</p>

<p>
"We returned together to the village.  I would
willingly have shaken off the youngster, but he
insisted on seeing Jessy home, and as I had no plea to
prevent him, I submitted in great bitterness of spirit.
</p>

<p>
"The next day he departed for London, to my great
solace, and we heard nothing of him for several months,
so I once more buckled to my schoolmaster's
labours with a light heart; and if my friends did not
flatter me, I also greatly improved in my preaching.
</p>

<p>
"At first, before I had confidence in my ain power
and presence of mind, I slavishly wrote down all my
sermons, and read them still more servilely, never
trusting my finger neb off the manuscript, as if I had
been frichtened it would have ta'en wing and flown
away from under my nose; but I gradually began to
trust mysell away in a wee bit flicht now and then, like
a half-fledged shillfa[<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>] with the puddock-hair on,
hopping about its nest, but always ready to drop into it
again, as I was into the written discourse.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn2text">2</a>] Chaffinch.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I soon found that the parts of my preachments
that were maist liked were generally the very bits thus
struck off <i>extempore</i>; so in time I took heart of grace,
and only wrote down the <i>heads</i>.  Before autumn I even
gave this up, and began to preach even on and boldly,
without scrap or note of any kind or description whatever.
</p>

<p>
"That there are many eloquent men who cannot trust
their memories, and have all their lives to preach
written sermons, is most true; but where a man of talent
<i>can</i> preach <i>extempore</i>, rely upon it, he will be more
eloquent and impressive than if he had undergone the
drudgery of inditing the discourse before hand.
</p>

<p>
"And so it was with me, even me Saunders Skelp;
for, from the very first, when per force I had to write
down my sermons, still even then I found my genius
cribbed and confined, and held down in its soarings
and highest aspirations by the written <i>thread</i> of my
discourse, like a string round the leg of a tame pyot;
or if, in a moment of inspiration, I did break away, it
was at the peril of getting into another vein of thocht
a'thegither, which I aften found cruel kittle to
dovetail cleverly into the plain jog-trot of what lay
beneath my nose on the pulpit cushion; so, finding I made
but a botched business of it so long as I halted between
the two opinions, I resolutely determined to write nae
mair for ever.
</p>

<p>
"But in the pride of my heart at my early success,
I will not conceal that I grew about this time rather
overly energetic, and my feelings whiles outran my
discretion; but I had a good friend and excellent Mentor
in auld Earl M&mdash;&mdash;, the principal heritor in the parish.
</p>

<p>
"Seeing his lordship in his pew&mdash;for he didna come
to the kirk every Sabbath&mdash;one fine clear day, when
I was to preach, I thought I would astonish him a wee
bit; but, as it turned out, I was mysell the maist
astonished of the twa.  It was a beautiful summer's day.
I had scarcely ever seen the outline of the mountain
that overhung the village so hard and clear and sharply
defined, as it hove up and out, high into the cold pure
blue of the cloudless sky.  The misty cap that usually
concealed the bald peak, had blown off before the
fresh breeze that rustled cheerily among the twittering
leaves; disclosing the grey scalp, the haunt of the
gled and the eagle, with the glittering streaks of
unmelted but not unsunned snow filling the wrinkle-like
storm rifts, whose ice-fed streamlets loomed in the
distance, still and fixed like frozen gouts of pure sea
foam, but lower down sparkled in the sun, flowing with
a perceptible motion, as if the hoary giant had been
shedding glad tears of dropping diamonds.
</p>

<p>
"Still nearer, the silver chainlets of their many
rills were welded into one small waterfall, that leapt
from its rocky ledge, white as the wreaths that fed
it; bending and wavering in the breeze, and gradually
thinning as it fell, until it blew off in smoke like the
Grey Mare's Tail, and vanished altogether, scarcely
moistening the black and moss-grown stones of the
shallow basin beneath.  Below this, and skirting the
dry region of shingle, the paired moorfowl, for the
cheepers hadna taken wing yet, were whirring amang
the purple heather, that glowed under the bright
sunlight, as if the mountain had been girdled in with a
ruby zone; while farther down, the sheep bleating to
their lambs powdered the whole green hillside, like
pearls sprinkled on a velvet mantle.
</p>

<p>
"The kine were lowing in the valley, as they stood
kneedeep in the cool burn, whisking away the flies,
under the vocal shadow of the overhanging <i>saughs</i>.
The grey heron was floating above the spung
from spring to spring, from one dark green tuft of
rushes to another, so ghostlike, that you could not tell
it from its shadow; the birds were singing among the
trees; the very crackling of the furze pods in the sun
had an exhilarating and joyous sound; and the drowsy
and moaning hum of the myriads of bees, that floated
into the wee auld kirk through the open window from
the plane-trees that overshadowed it, dangerous as the
sound wad hae been to a prosy preacher on a sultry
Sabbath, was, in my vainglory, but a soothing melody
to me: for in my vainglory I said to mysell, there
<i>shall</i> be nae sleeping here this day.  There was happiness
in the very cawing of the rooks in the auld trees
of the kirkyard, as they peered down at us with eyes
askance, as much as to say, 'ay, freens, there's nae gun
amang ye the day.'
</p>

<p>
"The farmers came along cracking blithely as they
looked over the sea of waving grain, now in ear, and
fast bronzing under the genial sun, that covered the
whole strath; the trouts were glancing and louping
at the grey flies, and the ducks of the villagers were
flaffing and squattering in the burn where the lassies
were washing their feet, glancing like silver amang
the sparkling wimples of the clear yet moss-browned
water, and putting on their shoes and stockings,
preparatory to their entering the sanctuary, therein
differing from the heathen, who cast off their slippers
at the threshold.  Auld Widow Miller hersell, sober
sedate body, was <i>heckling</i> with Tam Clink the
blacksmith, as she came along by the holly hedge; even
the hard-worked carrier's horses, with their galled
backs and shoulders, and the very banes sticking
through their flanks, were frisking awkwardly with
their iron joints (like so many of their wooden
scaffold-supporting namesakes bewitched), in clumsy
imitation of the beautiful filly there, and neighing
on the other side of the hedge from you, speaking
as plain as Balaam's ass that the Sabbath was for
them also; ay, when the very Spirit of God himself
seemed visibly abroad on the smiling face of the glad
earth, I could not help exclaiming&mdash;'Surely, my
friends, we cannot err greatly, if we veil our faces
and retreat in such a day as this from before the
thunders, and darkness, and earthquake of Sinai, the
Mountain of the Lord, and wander away out of the
bitterness and acrid atmosphere of the desert, 'where
the Heaven over our heads is brass, and the earth
under our feet iron, and the rain of the land powder
and dust,' into the quiet and fertile valleys and pure
skies of Canaan; and there, amongst the loveliness
and freshness of nature, with hearts swelling with
gratitude to <i>Him</i>, and love to our brethren of
mankind, dwell on <i>His</i> attributes of goodness and mercy,
with mixed adoration and trembling, and endeavour
to sing his praises in the spirit, and with the glorious
imagery of David.&mdash;Shall all the beasts of the field,'
I continued, warming with my subject,&mdash;'shall all the
beasts of the field, and fowls of the air, and fishes,
yea, shall all creatures, animate and inanimate, praise
the Lord for his goodness, with one universal burst of
joy; and shall man alone, while he worships with fear
and trembling, not mingle with the groan of his just
humiliation a shout of heartwarm and heartfelt
gratitude to the Almighty Dispenser of all this happiness
around him?'
</p>

<p>
"For a quarter of an hour after this I carried on fine,
and was delighted to spy the auld earl's looks, of
approval with the corner of my ee, the joy whereof drave
me off my guard; for at a well-turned period, when I
intended to bring my right hand down thump on the
open Bible, I missed it, and smote the new elastic
pulpit cushion instead, with such vehemence, that the old
brazen-clasped Psalm-book spanged up, and out over
into the air.  'Kep!' cried I; whereupon auld Durie
Squake, the precentor, upturned his face, and thereby
caught such a bash on the nose, that baith the lozens
were dang out of his barnacles.  'Oh Lord, my sair
nose!' (it had not recovered the blow against the door,
as already related), 'oh Lord! my sair nose is clean
demolished now&mdash;I maun get legs to my specs&mdash;for
the brig's brak, and flattened in on my face like a
pancake!'  I tried to get back into my discourse, but I
was awfully flurried, and as, not knowing what I did,
I let fly another whack on the desk, his lordship, who,
I could observe, even in the swelter of my confusion,
was laughing to himsell, turned up his gaisened
pheesiognomy, and <i>girned</i> out&mdash;'I say, my lad, if ye break
it, ye'll pay for't.'  This put me daft&mdash;clean wud
a'thegether&mdash;and I drave along at so furious a rate, and
stamped with my stick-leg on the stool that I stood on
with such vehemence, that in my confusion down I
slipped; and the bottom of the pulpit being auld and
frush, the wooden tram flew crash through, and I
vanished, the iron-shod end striking Durie Squake, the
devoted precentor, such a crack on the tap of the head,
that I thought I had felled him clean.  'Oh dear! oh
dear!' roared Squake; 'the callant has first bashed my
neb as saft as pap' (he was a wabster to his trade), 'and
broken my spectacles, and noo he has fractured my
skull with his d&mdash;d stick-leg.'  I struggled to extricate
the tram, but it stuck fast, until Tam Clink, the
blacksmith, gave the end of it, as it protruded into Durie
Squake's desk, such a bang with his great heavy hand,
as if it had been his forehammer, that he shot me up
with a jerk like a 'Jack in the box,' into the sight of
the astonished congregation again.
</p>

<p>
"I sat down utterly discomfited, and, covering my
face with my hands, wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"A murmur ran through the kirk, and I could hear
whispers of 'Puir callant, gie him time to collect his
thochts&mdash;gie him time&mdash;he's a clever lad Saunders&mdash;he'll
be a' richt presently.'  I took heart of grace at
this demonstration of good and kindly feeling amongst
my fellow-parishioners, and making a strong effort, yet
with a face like crimson&mdash;my lugs were burning like
red-hot iron&mdash;I finished my discourse, and dismissed
the congregation.  As I passed out of the churchyard
gate, I found the old lord there; it was a warm day,
and he was sitting on a tombstone under the shade of
the auld elm-tree, with his hat off, and wiping his
forehead with his handkerchief, apparently waiting for his
carriage to drive up.  'Ca' canny, man,' said he, as I
approached&mdash;'Ca' canny, Saunders&mdash;dinna <i>rive</i> folk
alang the road to heaven at that rate, man.'
</p>

<p>
"'My lord, I was seduced intil that exuberance
to-day against my better judgment.  It was the vanity of
making an appearance before you, my lord, when I
ought to have been thinking only of my Maker and the
Gospel, and I have determined to humble my pride by
making this acknowledgment; but I have had a sair
downcome, my lord, as you saw this morning, and I
deserved it.'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, well, Saunders; but Durie Squake had the
worst of the <i>downcome</i>, I'm thinking.  However, let
it be a lesson to you never to prostrate yourself so
abjectly before a fellow-creature again, even if he should
be a lord, Saunders; but as you are a lad of talent, and
I have a regard for you, you must get over this
mortification speedily, lest it rankle and spoil your
usefulness, for I see you are a sensitive creature.  So I'll
gang down to the manse and rest my sell, and come back
in the afternoon, when I will ask Mr Bland to let you
preach again.  So awa' wi' ye, Saunders; ca' in yere
scattered thochts, Saunders&mdash;and tell Moses, as you pass
Lucky Mutchkin's public, to put up the horses again.
Awa' wi' ye, Saunders Skelp.'
</p>

<p>
"'Na, na, my lord&mdash;you are very kind, and I am
greatly beholden to your lordship; but I canna&mdash;I
canna hand up my head in the poopit again, so soon
after my signal dis'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Haud yere tongue, Saunders&mdash;ye're a fule.  Gang
till your room and cogitate, for preach you must and
shall, this very day, and be d&mdash;d till ye.  The
dominie's gane mad a'thegither, I declare.'
</p>

<p>
"I took my excellent patron's advice, and although
unco blate at first, I gained courage as I warmed with
my subject, so that by the time I cam till the blessing,
I was myself again; and having thus got over my
mortification, I never afterwards sae far forgot myself as I
had done that blessed morning."
</p>

<p>
But the humour of the following extract, which
explains itself, surpasses either of the former in my
estimation:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Next morning was the annual examination of my
school, at which three ministers, one of them the
celebrated Dr Soorock, were to be present, and the same
passed over creditably to myself and scholars; and the
doctor was very kind and condescending to the whole
of us.  He was the means of my being invited this
day to dinner by Mr Bland.  After the examination,
we had walked a mile into the country together,
enjoying the delight of the schoolboys, who had gotten
a half holiday on the occasion, and were now
rampaging about, like young colts broke loose, some
jumping, some playing at football, others at shinty, while
several were fishing in the burn, that twinkled past
as clear as crystal; and we were returning home to
the manse, when Earl M&mdash;&mdash;'s equipage appeared,
coming along the small bridge that crossed a bend of
the stream beyond the village.  Presently it was hid
by the trees round the manse, and then glanced on this
side of them, until the houses again concealed it.  In
another moment it rattled sharply round the corner, when
the old earl desired his postilions to walk their horses
until he met us.  The moment Doctor Soorock saw
the carriage go slow, he accelerated <i>his</i> motion, and
stepped out and away before Mr Bland and Mr Clour,
salaaming with his hat in one hand, and his gold-headed
cane in the other, in rather too abject a style, in
my estimation, for <i>one who had a kirk already</i>.  His
lordship was still at pistol-shot distance, and the doctor
was striding on, uncovered, with his eyes riveted on the
carriage, when his foot caught on the projecting steps
of the schoolhouse door, and away he went, his stick
flying through the window, smashing the glass down in
a tinkling shower&mdash;his hat into the neighbouring
pigsty, and his wig into the burn that ran by the road-side.
</p>

<p>
"'Run, boys, run,' said I, as I helped him up,&mdash;'run
and catch the doctor's wig,' as it floated away
down the stream, like a hedgehog covered with meal.
</p>

<p>
"'Geordie,' cried one little fellow, 'hook the wig
with your fly, man&mdash;hook the wig with your fly.'
</p>

<p>
"'Allan is fishing with bait, his hooks are bigger,'
quoth Geordie.
</p>

<p>
"'Fling, Allan, man, fling&mdash;one gude cast, and you
have it.'
</p>

<p>
"They both missed, and the wig continued floating
down until it swam amongst a flock of village ducks,
who instantly squattered away from it, as if it had been
an otter.
</p>

<p>
"'Cast a stane intil't, or it will soom to Berwick
before nicht,' said wee Tam.
</p>

<p>
"'Cast a stane intil't, Allan, man; you mark weel,'
roared Geordie again.
</p>

<p>
"Flash&mdash;one stone pitched into the burn, close to
it, and half filled the wig with water.  It was pretty
well saturated before, so that when another flew with
better aim right into it, it instantly sank, and
disappeared in the Dominie's Hole, as the pool was called.
What was to be done?  There was a spate had
suddenly come down the water, and there was no seeing
into the bottom of the pool; besides, there was not a
creepy in the village, so the doctor gave his wig up for
lost, as well he might, and had to cover the nakedness
of the land for that day with one of Mr Eland's
Kilmarnock nightcaps.  He bore his misfortune, I will
say, with great equanimity; and in the evening we all
once more resorted to the schoolhouse, to hear the
boys sing, led by auld Durie Squake.
</p>

<p>
"We had taken our seats, a number of the villagers
in their best; auld Durie had sounded his pitch-pipe,
and the bits of callants were watching him with open
mouth, all ready to open in full cry, like a pack of
young hounds waiting for old Jowler's deep tongue,
when the candle at his desk was suddenly blown out,
and I called out in Latin, seeing that some of the
bigger boys were close to it, '<i>Quid hac rei?</i>'  Wee
Tam Stump at this louped off his seat with great
energy, fearing he was about to be blamed: 'Ventus
played puff, Dominie, ex that broken window, et
extinxit the candle.'  We had all a good laugh at this,
and nothing more happened to disturb the harmony of
the evening, until Allan Harden came running up the
stairs, with a salmon lister in one hand, and a great
dripping divot-looking thing on the top of it.
</p>

<p>
"'What kept ye so late?' said I; 'you are seldom
late, Allan.'
</p>

<p>
"'I hae been dabbing with the lister the haill
evening for Doctor Soorock's wig, sir; but I have speared
it at last&mdash;<i>ecce signum</i>!  Dominie.'
</p>

<p>
"A tiny buzz ran amongst the boys; auld Clour
keckled audibly, and Mr Bland could scarcely keep his
gravity, as Dr Soorock stirred the soaked mass that
Allan had cast on the floor with the end of his cane,
exclaiming&mdash;'My wig&mdash;my wig, did the callant say?
It canna be my wig.'
</p>

<p>
"'Indeed it is yours, sir; there's nae wale o' wigs
here,' said the handsome boy, blushing deeply&mdash;'if
you but try it on, sir, ye'll find it sae.'
</p>

<p>
"The wig was finally turned over to the auld barber
at the village, who dried it, but the doctor had to
go home in the Kilmarnock on the following day, as
the scratch was ruined for ever."
</p>

<p>
Now, a small touch at the Dominie in the "melting
mood," and we bear up again on our cruise.  He
had returned to the parish, after having completed his
education, such as it was.
</p>

<p>
"Months passed away without any thing worth
notice occurring.  I met Jessy often, and although some
doubts and misgivings as to the state of her heart did
come over me, and shake mine sometimes, still my
anxiety to acquire the plighted hundred pounds diverted
my mind from allowing the doubt to fester, by confining
my attention chiefly to the school.  Besides, the
young laird, who was now studying the law in Edinburgh,
came seldomer down to the auld castle than was
his wont; so that altogether I began to attribute any
little apparent coldness in Jessy's demeanour, either to
my own fancy, or to being piqued by the unjustness of
my former suspicions.  Thus I struggled on, in the hope
that the sum might be made up during the next summer
at latest, until which time my pride counselled me
to be silent.
</p>

<p>
"The long dreary winter drew on apace.  The leaves
became sere, and fell, and were whirled in rustling
eddies along the hollows of the small woodland paths
about the village,&mdash;and the bleak north howled on the
hill-side, and moaned and soughed through the trees,
and round the house,&mdash;and the herds began to fold
their flocks in the evenings.  One night, in particular,
was marked in my memory indelibly by what occurred
the morning after it.  It was late in November, and
the weather for several days previous had been rough
and boisterous, but on this particular evening it had
cleared.  The full moon shone brightly as I returned
from the county town, with a wallet of wee books for
my youngest class, which I had bought there that
afternoon.  It was eleven at night as I got to the bridge
across the stream which ran past the village; I was
glouring down over the little parapet wall into the
glancing water, that rushed and murmured through
below the arch, and listening to the melancholy bleating
of the sheep on the hill above me, and to the low bark
of the colleys, and the distant shout of the herds, as
the last of the stragglers were got within the circular
folds, far up on the moor.  Again I would look towards
the village, where scarce a light twinkled, except in
Tam Clink the blacksmith's shop, where every now
and then a primrose-coloured jet of flame puffed
up, and flashed on the blacksmith's begrimed face
and hairy chest, and naked arms, and on wee Pate
Clink's bit dirty face and curly pow, as the callant
worked at the bellows; but the fire suddenly
gaed out, and the sparks flew from a red-hot bar
in all directions, under the powerful stroke of the
blacksmith himsell, until the hissing iron became of a
dull red, and gradually disappeared from my eye
altogether.  Presently the strokes ceased&mdash;the groaning
and asthmatic wheezing of the bellows subsided&mdash;and
the noise of the man locking the door of his small shop
showed that the last of the villagers had finished the
labours of the day; and I had time to notice that snow
was beginning to fall.
</p>

<p>
"I got home, and let myself in without disturbing
my auld father, and slept soundly till daylight next
morning.
</p>

<p>
"There was none of the villagers asteer when I
got up.  A sprinkling of snow, as already mentioned,
had fallen during the night, which had been so calm,
that the white veil which covered the dying face of
nature was unsoiled and without a rent, over all the
level country; and the road through the village was one
unbroken sheet of the purest white, unpolluted as yet
by a single footstep&mdash;what do I say? there was <i>one</i>
footprint there, the recollection of which is
indelible from my brain, as the mark on Cain's forehead.
</p>

<p>
"As I opened the door to step forth, I noticed the
mark of a man's foot, as if some one had come down
the small lane, that ran at right angles with the road,
and past the end of the house, towards the little
projecting steps in front of the door.  'Well,' thought
I&mdash;'well&mdash;it may have been my father's, or some one
of the villagers may have been earlier up than I
apprehended;' and I stepped on, wondering in my own
mind what made me notice the steps at all.  'But I
am a fool, for one does notice the footprints after the
first fall of snow of the season with an interest that
we cannot always account for,' said I to myself, as I
stepped into the path that led to the school, where I
was going to light the fire.  I again started as I looked
down, for I now noticed, to my surprise, that the
footprints exactly resembled my own, with the round mark
of the ring at the end of my stick-leg distinct in the snow.
'Why, I did not come this way home, did I?' again
communed I with myself; 'certainly I did not; and
there was no snow when I came from the school,
before I set out for the town.  How came these
footprints here?&mdash;what can it mean?' and mechanically I
traced them as far as I could, until the mark of the
wooden leg suddenly vanished, and was replaced by the
print of a boot or shoe, for a few paces farther; when the
marks disappeared altogether, as if the person had turned
off suddenly through a gap in the hedge.  I was a good
deal startled at all this&mdash;Could I have been walking in
my sleep?&mdash;This was scarcely credible; I had never
done so, and if I had, which I could not believe, how
came my shrunk leg to be miraculously straightened
on the instant?  For whatever it was, man or spirit,
it must have stumped along for fifty yards on a leg of
flesh, and a tram of wood, and then suddenly have
dropped the agency of the latter, and turned sharp into
the fields on two feet, such us everyday men wear;
besides, the person, whoever he was, wore iron-heeled
square-toed boots or shoes; and I saw no mark of my
own tackets, or round <i>brogue</i>-like toes.
</p>

<p>
"I walked on until I came to the steps of the
schoolroom, in a brown study, with the crisp
new-fallen snow crunching beneath my tread, and I had
nearly given a second edition of Doctor Soorock's
downfall before I fairly awoke to the routine of this
sublunary world, and betook myself to the unromantic
occupation of lighting the fire.  I sat down and took
up the bellows, but it seemed I had forgotten to make
use of them; for there I had been cowering by the
ingle-cheek near an hour, pondering in my own mind
what the footprints could mean, and quite unconscious
all this time that the morning, in place of getting
lighter, had settled down very dark.  The wind had
also suddenly risen, and the branches of the auld elm
that overshadowed the schoolhouse were groaning
and rasping on the ridge of the roof; and Betty
Mutchkin's sign, that hung on the opposite side of
the road from a long projecting beam, as if it had been
a flag, was swinging and creaking on its rusty hinges
before the angry gusts, as they tore down the small
valley.  At length I was startled by the fury with
which a hail shower dashed against the window at my
lug, utterly demolishing in a minute the sheet of
brown paper with which, until the village glazier
sobered, and got a pane from Edinburgh, I had <i>battered</i>
up the fracture occasioned by Dr Soorock's cane, when
he was humbling himself, and bowing down before the
golden coronet on auld Earl M&mdash;&mdash;'s carriage.
</p>

<p>
"'Dear me,' said I, 'what a day!  It's but gloomy
without, and I'm no sure that it's very cheery within;
for there's a weight that has been lang accumulating
at my heart, and now it has grown heavy, heavy.  The
lift will clear, and the spring will come again, and all
nature, as if risen from the grave, as we puir deevils
hope to do, will resume its primeval beauty; but a
seared heart, a blighted soul,'&mdash;and I gave a heavy
sigh, while the very bellows on my knees seemed
suddenly to collapse of themselves, as if in sympathy,
and to puff out an echo to my groan.
</p>

<p>
"I felt a rough shake on the shoulder.  'What <i>are</i>
you sitting groaning at there, Dominie?' said my father,
who had entered unseen and unheard&mdash;'what are you
grunting and graning at the fireside on such a morning
as this for, Saunders, when you should have had a bit
cheery fire in the ingle for the drookit school-callants
to dry themselves at, instead of dreaming with the
bellows on your knee, and the fire black out?'
</p>

<p>
"I looked, and it was even so.  'I dinna ken,
father, I am ill at ease; but if I am spared'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Nonsense!' quoth the hasty old sutor; 'get up,
Saunders, and clap a fresh spunk to the fire, whether
you're spared or no, or I'll tak ye siccan a clamhewit
with my stick,'&mdash;&mdash;The good old man the next
moment, however, saw how it was with me, and relenting
said&mdash;'but come awa hame like a decent callant, and tak
yere breakfast, man; and you will have scrimp time to
eat it, let me tell you, for see,'&mdash;pulling out an old
turnip-shaped horologe, with great steel hands&mdash;'it is
within the twenty minutes of school-time already.'
</p>

<p>
"I made an effort, lighted the fire again, and
rousing myself, went forth with him towards our dwelling.
The snow was fast disappearing under the pelting of
a heavy shower of sleet, that had succeeded the
hailstorm, and a loud clap of thunder shook the
firmament as we arrived at home.  I started&mdash;'It's no
common to hear thunder at this time o' year, father.'
</p>

<p>
"'Come in and tak your breakfast, sir&mdash;the deevil's
in the gaumerell, that I should say sae.'  I did so in
silence, and returned to the school, where I found
myself without my hat, my hair wet and dripping, and
the back of my neck chilled, from the lodging of the
hail within the cape of my coat.
</p>

<p>
"One of my dreamy fits had again come over me,
which, however, I struggled hard to overcome;
so I sat down at my small desk, and unlocked my
drawer, from whence I took out the tawse and laid them
on the closed Bible, as a terror to evil-doers; and
placing my watch beside them, I waited the entry of my
scholars.  First one wee drooked chiel came in, and
syne another, but most of them were beyond the time,
for the day was bad, and after they had all taken their
places, there was a perfect volley of hoasting.  I could
not skelp any of them for being late that morning.&mdash;About
half an hour had elapsed, and I had set the
boys to some task; there was a loud hum in the
school, from their murmuring voices, and I was
looking out towards the road, at the swollen stream,
that I saw but last night sparkling and tinkling over
its more than half-dry channel, in a tiny stream that I
could have stepped across, but that now surged along
brimful, in a red discoloured torrent, tearing the trees
and pailings, and whatever else it could reach on its
banks away, and rolling them down with such fury,
that I expected to see the arch of the small bridge sink
and disappear, like a wall going down before the
strokes of a battering-ram.  A group of the villagers
on the opposite side from where I stood were fishing
out the floating timber for firewood; but my attention
was soon attracted to the carrier's cart from town,
that was coming along the road, with auld Hempy
himself&mdash;that was the man's name that had succeeded
poor Jemmy Miller in his vocation&mdash;and his wee son
Andrew, cocked up in the front of the cart.  The
river continued to rise, and covered a bend of the
road, which the cart was now approaching; it entered
the water, which the horse was making flash up in all
directions, until it reached the axle, but it gradually
shoaled again, and the vehicle was on the point of
reaching the dry part of the road, when, like a shot,
man and boy, and horse and cart, disappeared amidst
the roaring eddies.
</p>

<p>
"I ran out; the villagers had noticed the accident
also; we all hurried to the spot.  The horse was
struggling and snorting, and standing on his hind legs,
between the trams, in a vain attempt to get free from
the cart that was dragging him down the stream, but
auld Hempy had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"'What's that?  There's the callant, there's the
callant&mdash;see his bit head sooming down the stream like
an otter'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I saw it, threw off my coat, and plunged in; but
the upshot was, that although Tam Clink the blacksmith
saved the <i>child</i>, the <i>dominie</i> was near drowned;
for I found to my cost that a stick-leg wasna canny to
soom with, the buoyancy thereof producing a corresponding
and very dangerous depression of the caput.
</p>

<p>
"We saved the boy; but the horse and cart, and
Hempy himsell, were all drowned; it was the first
time, I mind, that I had ever seen a dead corpse.  The
puir auld chiel was a stout buirdly man&mdash;he might
have weighed sixteen stone; but when we gat him
that forenoon, after the river had cast him ashore, stark
and stiff, and carried him, and laid him out in the kirk
aisle, it was fearful to observe how he had shrunk in
bulk after the water had ran oot o' him; it wasna aften
he took muckle o' that same in, so it was a sure sign
he was dead; his stomach having fallen, had left the
arch of his deep chest in fearful relief, and then the
pinching of his blue features and the death-girn on his
upper lip, that showed his twa buck teeth as if in
anger&mdash;It was a maist awfu' sicht.
</p>

<p>
"'What! are you frichtened, Saunders?' said a
voice close to me&mdash;'are you frichtened to look on a
dead man, dominie?  If you had been in Paris with
me last summer, man, you would have seen a dozen
lying every morning in the Morgue&mdash;ay, as nice and
caller as if they had been haddies in a fishmonger's
shop.'
</p>

<p>
"I looked up at the heartless creature.  'He was
the father of a family, Mr Adderfang, and that drooked
and shivering callant, that's greeting there at the
head of the corp, is his son; and mair forby, he was a
tenant o' yeer ain, sir, and'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He turned fiercely&mdash;'Keep your sentimentality
for your next sermon, sir;' and he looked at me with
a withering scowl that sent a chill to my heart.  I felt
a blighting of the soul that I would not willingly have
acknowledged&mdash;a sort of crushing consciousness, that
the person before me was in very deed my evil genius;
but the <i>consciousness</i> of such a feeling drove me in the
present instance to return his savage look as haughtily
as it was given; and I made a sudden motion with my
hand, which made him start back, and grasp the sma'
end of his long hammer-headed hunting whip.&mdash;'I say,
dominie, I do not <i>quite</i> understand you this
morning; but, by G&mdash;, sir, if you give me an opportunity
I will read you a lesson that is not in your primer.'&mdash;And
he raised his whip threateningly.  He was, as
I have before mentioned, a tall well-put-together man,
as we say in Lincumdodie, and far more than a match
for me, at my best, when I had twa legs, and therefore
incomparably my superior in bodily strength and
activity, maimed as I now was.  However, I took no time
to consider of all this, but making a sudden spring, I
wrenched his whip from him, and as he swerved from
me, he fell over the trestle whereon the body of the
carrier lay, and upset it, to the great horror of the
bystanders; and there lay, side by side, the living scoffer
and the dead corpse.  A murmur of something that
hovered between applause and disapprobation buzzed
amongst the group of villagers; and the wee callant
cried loud and bitterly, when, as the laird was in the
act of gathering himself up, Mr Bland himsell entered
the kirk, and with more sternness in his countenance
than I had ever seen there before.
</p>

<p>
"'Mr Adderfang,' said he to the young man, 'what
is the meaning of all this?&mdash;Is it becoming in a
gentleman of your rank to desecrate the House of
God by heartless and ill-timed levity, first of all; for
I have heard the story from one of my elders; and
then to threaten an unoffending schoolmaster&mdash;ay, sir,'&mdash;for
here Adderfang seemed on the point of contradicting
the minister&mdash;'ay, sir, and, to the credit of
your discretion be it said, a maimed man, too?  Was
this decent? was it gentlemanly?'
</p>

<p>
"Here the poor wife of the carrier, with her clothes
dripping with water, and splashed with red clay stains
from the miry road, without her mutch, her grey
haffits clotted with rain and perspiration over her blue
and shrunken features, and with her lip quivering,
rushed into the church.
</p>

<p>
"'Whar is he&mdash;whar is he&mdash;whar is my Willie?'  The
instant her eye rested on the body she gave a
long loud shriek, that echoed along the roof, and fell
down on it senseless.  We had the poor woman
removed, and by that time Mr Adderfang had disappeared."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
But the plot was fast thickening both with the
dominie and poor Jessy Miller.
</p>

<p>
Widow Miller's humble domicile was divided from
the house where our friend the dominie reposed, by a
narrow lane.  It stood three or four yards back from
the frontage of the neighbouring cottages, which
afforded space for a small parterre of flowers, at one time
the pride of poor Jessy's heart, and watered with her
own hands; but many a hot tear had lately trickled on
their leaves, down the poor girl's pale and faded
countenance, and strange rumours had become rife in the
secluded village of the flower of the whole strath having
been tainted by the blight of some scoundrel.  Her
anxious and altered appearance, and the evident misery
of the poor widow her mother, were melancholy proofs
of the correctness of the surmise.
</p>

<p>
<i>Gradually the sough settled down on Saunders
Skelp</i>&mdash;for who so likely to be the cause as the
avowed lover of the girl, and, as people thought, her
betrothed husband?
</p>

<p>
The report of Jessy's misfortune soon reached the
person whom it most concerned.  At first it fairly
stunned him, and then such crushing misery overwhelmed
the poor fellow's whole soul, when he became
convinced of its truth, that it nearly drove him mad
altogether.
</p>

<p>
The morning after he had been made acquainted with
the heart-breaking fact, the dominie was sitting dejectedly
at the breakfast-table (with his elbow planted quite
unconcernedly in the very middle of the plate <i>among the
het parritch</i>), opposite the auld <i>betherel</i>,[<a id="chap11fn3text"></a><a href="#chap11fn3">3</a>] who was
munching his food in silence, and eyeing his son every
now and then with a most vinegar aspect.  At length
he broke out&mdash;"Braw wark, dominie&mdash;braw wark ye
have made o't atween ye."  (The poor fellow raised his
disconsolate visage, and looked innocently in his
parent's face.)  "Ay, you may look surprised Saunders,
but that sham sheep face will no deceive me;
for&mdash;God forgie me, but I wonder the sicht did not turn
me intil stane&mdash;I marked you come out o' Jessy
Miller's window this blessed morning at grey daylicht,
stick-leg and grey coat, just as you sit there, as plain
as I see ye the noo."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn3text">3</a>] Betherel, or minister's man.  <i>Anglice</i>, beadle.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The poor fellow was roused almost to madness at
this unjust and most cruel aspersion, and denied most
vehemently that he had been out of the house that
morning at all.  But the old man <i>threeped</i> that he
saw him bodily stump through the wee garden, and
disappear round the corner, where he had no doubt he
had stolen in by the window of his room that fronted
that way, but which he could not see from where he
stood.
</p>

<p>
"It couldna be me, father; as I sall answer to God
it wasna me.  My wraith it may have been."
</p>

<p>
"If it was <i>your</i> wraith, Saunders, it wasna the
wraith o' a <i>timmer-leg</i>? for there are the prints of ane
to be seen till this blessed moment, amang the flowers
o' the garden and the glawr of the lane.  Tam Clink
will vouch for this as well as me, for he saw you too."
</p>

<p>
Saunders, half crazy at this damning tissue of
circumstantial, although false, evidence, rose and went
out to satisfy himself.  After inspecting the foot-marks,
for there they were, sure enough, he returned to the
house, and the first thing he did now was to gobble
up his food, scalding hot as it was, as if he had been
perishing of hunger.  He then rose, and was rushing
down stairs distractedly&mdash;when lo! who should enter
but Mr Bland the minister?
</p>

<p>
Here there was a new scene of crimination; and the
poor creature was like to have made an end of himself
in his despair, for when he seized the big "ha' Bible,"
and was about making oath upon it to his innocence,
the minister took it forcibly from him.
</p>

<p>
"Not in my presence, young man&mdash;not before me
shall you imprecate the curse of the Almighty on the
head of a perjurer."
</p>

<p>
"Minister, minister, wad you hae my death&mdash;the
death maybe of sowl and body&mdash;lie at your door?  Send
for Jessy Miller&mdash;lost creature as she is&mdash;send for
her.  She will not&mdash;she cannot condemn me."
</p>

<p>
"Jessy Miller, sir!&mdash;the oath of a limmer like her
is no worth a wunnlestrae."
</p>

<p>
At this he sprang forth like a wild-beast when the
goad is struck into him, and out to the hill-side, nor
did he venture home that night.
</p>

<p>
Listen.
</p>

<p>
"The snow had fallen about the dawning, and,
benumbed with cold, I was returning from my night-lair
on the damp hill-side towards the village, with a
determination to flee the bounds thereof, after once
more trying to undeceive my auld father; for it was a
dreary thocht to travel forth burdened with my ain
misery, and the heavy load of a father's curse forby.
As I came down the small lane, and got my first
glimpse of Widow Miller's house, I stopped to take a
last look at the bit bourock that sheltered her for
whom, only twa days gane, I would have shed my
reddest heart's-blood rather than sin or sorrow should have
scathed her, or come near her dwelling.  It was as yet
scrimp daylight, naebody was stirring.  The only
indication of life (barring the twittering of the birdies
in the trees, and the crowing of the cocks) was a thread
of blue peat smoke rising from a cottage in the village,
here and there; but the east was fast reddening, when
lo! I saw the window of Jessy's room open gently,
and, <i>what shall I say&mdash;what did I see</i>&mdash;but a wooden-leg,
so sure as I was a sinful man, protrude therefrom!
I went blin'&mdash;I went blin';&mdash;as I saw mysell,
grey frock, timmer-tram and all, jump into the wee
garden, open the small wicker-gate, and stump away
in the direction of the manse.
</p>

<p>
"I was petrified with astonishment, frozen to the
spot, until my wraith, for assuredly I considered it
nothing else, arrived at the gate leading into the
minister's garden, when it turned; and then, as if in great
alarm, suddenly rushed through the small gate and
disappeared.  I was roused, and now started off in
pursuit at the very top of my speed, but reached the gate
only in time to see the figure clear the holly hedge
that screened the front of the manse, at a bound, with
the wooden-leg unstrapped and flourishing in its hand,
and vanish beyond it.  I had then to make a small
detour to get through the wicket in the fence; but
before I got round, whatever it might have been, it was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"I ran up to the door in breathless haste, and, early
as it was, began to knock furiously for admittance,
without well thinking what I was about.  No one
answered, and an open window on the ground-floor now
attracted my attention.  I looked in&mdash;and who should
I see snoring on 'the bred of his back,' in his wee
fold-down pallet, but young Moses Bland, the helper,
with&mdash;I went frantic at the sight&mdash;the ghost of my
ain wooden leg lying across the body!
</p>

<p>
"'Now I have run the fox to earth,' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'And wha makes such an indecent uproar at the
door, at such an untimeous season?' quoth the <i>auld
minister</i>, from an upper window.
</p>

<p>
"'It is me, sir&mdash;I Saunders Skelp, wha ye hae sae
unjustly maligned, minister.  Gude forgie me that I
should say so.'
</p>

<p>
"'Off with you, ye scoonrel,' quoth the usually mild
minister&mdash;'off with you, sir, or I'll make you repent it.'
</p>

<p>
"'Na, minister, when you are cool, you will
yoursell repent your conduct to me.  Here, sir, tak your
cloak about you, and come down <i>here</i>&mdash;you'll soon see
that the evildoer is nearer a-kin to you than Saunders
Skelp.'"
</p>

<p>
The minister came down, and now there was the
devil to pay between him and his helper; but the
latter protested his innocence so vehemently, that at
length the dominie was unceremoniously ejected, with
the additional accusation sticking to him, of having
in cold blood, and for purposes of deceit, actually made
a duplicate of his wooden-leg, in order to cast the
blame on young Mr Bland.  He was thus on the eve
of getting set deeper and faster in the mire than ever,
when in came the betherel and Tam Clink, who, being
on the watch, had seen Saunders pursue his own <i>double</i>
towards the manse, so that Moses Bland once more
became the subject of suspicion.
</p>

<p>
The affair was largely canvassed that forenoon at a
meeting of the elders, and the injurious surmises were
gaining strength against poor Moses, notwithstanding:
his frantic protestations that he "kenn'd na whether
Jessy Miller was man or woman."  But Saunders,
when he brought his sober judgment to bear on the
matter, was the first to acquit him, for his kind heart
would not allow him to believe that his tried friend
and old schoolfellow, the helper, could be guilty of such
atrocious conduct; while something whispered him that
his evil genius, William Adderfang, was the villain;
however little appearances in the mean time might
tend to such a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
During that day, the mysterious transaction of
the <i>double</i> got wind in the village, and every ingle
cheek was filled with the sound of keen disputation.
The fact of the apparition was unquestionably proved
by Tam Clink and the betherel, putting Saunders' own
evidence out of the question; but whether it was the deil
himsell, or a dweller on this earth, afforded large scope
for doubt and argument.  Tam Clink was inclined to
believe in the mortality of the duplicate Saunders, "as
he had weel examined the counterfeit tram, and it was
sound maple, with nae smell of fire ava, let abee
brimstane," and Tam was a judge.  It happened to be a
holiday at the small school, so the poor fellow again
stole away to commune with himself on the hill-side,
and to escape the gaze of his humble acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
It was a most beautiful breezy forenoon, and from
the spot where he had planted himself, he had a
bird's-eye view of the <i>duke's</i> hounds, on the opposite swell
of the river-divided valley, and the whole field of
gallant sportsmen.  It was the last day of the season,
and in the cover they were drawing, that was alive
with red coats and white hounds (the latter diminished
by distance to a handful of hailstones pattering and
glancing among the dark bushes), the whips, and three
<i>scoonrel chields</i> were busy digging out a litter of cub
foxes from one of the earths, amidst a chorus of merry
voices and loud laughter.  Presently the old bitch broke
cover from another mouth, when the whole pack opened
most musically, and away went the jovial party as hard
as they could split, their tallyho's making the whole
strath ring again.
</p>

<p>
At first, the fresh air and quiet loveliness of nature
had gradually stolen over his soul in spite of himself,
and stilled its troubled heavings, like oil calming the
stormy waters of the sea; and now the exhilaration of
the scene, like the flowing tide lifting a stranded vessel
off the rocks, was imperceptibly lightening that more
perilous stuff, the duller load of misery that pressed
closer and more suffocatingly on the poor fellow's
heart&mdash;when lo! just as the foxhounds disappeared from the
river, the wasted form of poor Jessy Miller was seen
slowly and painfully crawling up the hill towards
where the dominie sat, leaning on her staff, and feeble
as an infant.
</p>

<p>
He saw her from the first, but could not move&mdash;something
nailed him to the spot.  She approached, but
for a minute was so breathless and exhausted, that she
could not speak&mdash;"Saunders Skelp!"&mdash;at length
moaned the poor broken-hearted girl&mdash;"Saunders!&mdash;ye
are going to tak the sacrament the morn," she
paused, and leant, "<i>peching</i> on her staff," as the
MS. hath it&mdash;"Ay, Saunders, ye are going to commemorate
our Saviour's death, and&mdash;and&mdash;I am gaun to dee,
Saunders."
</p>

<p>
"The tears ran down her cheeks, and I was like to
be worried mysell, for greet I couldna.
</p>

<p>
"'Saunders.  Is it no written, that if thou hast
ought against thy brother, thou shalt leave thy gift
before the altar, and first go and be reconciled unto thy
brother?'
</p>

<p>
"'Even sae&mdash;sae is it even written, Jessy.'
</p>

<p>
"'Time <i>has</i> been when you aften said I was dearer
till you than mony sisters&mdash;but that's past and
gane&mdash;gane like the last winter's snaw; yet is Saunders
Skelp's hate sae deadly that he refuses to tak off
Jessy Miller's parting and sin-clogged soul, the
grievous weight of his own bitter, bitter curse.'  She
waited lang for an answer, but I gied her nane&mdash;'I cam
to ask yere forgiveness, Saunders&mdash;<i>and I hae asked
it</i>'&mdash;here she grat as if her heart was
bursting&mdash;'and&mdash;and&mdash;oh God, whom I have offended, cast me not
off in this my utmost need&mdash;<i>and I have been refused</i>&mdash;one
struggle more, and my task is ended, Saunders'&mdash;and
she caught my hand in baith of hers whether I
would or no&mdash;they were cauld, cauld as lead&mdash;'I hae
deserved this; but hand my heart, <i>I didna expect
it</i>&mdash;Saunders, I have only now to say God bless you, and
to bid you fareweel for ever.'  She sank down on
the whin-stane at my feet&mdash;the fiend had seared my
heart harder than it, and I never even offered to help
her up.
</p>

<p>
"I thought she was <i>awa</i> awthegither; at last, gathering
strength, she spak the last words I ever heard
her utter.
</p>

<p>
"'I am come to clear Moses Bland, and to richt
you, Saunders.'
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the sweet low music of that mournful voice!
</p>

<p>
"'The young laird&mdash;Mr Adderfang'&mdash;she <i>gasped</i>, it
could nae langer be called speaking&mdash;'that <i>serpent</i>,
William Adderfang, has been the ruin o' me&mdash;ruin here,
and&mdash;and&mdash;condemnation in the world to come.'
</p>

<p>
"She bent her head, and hid her face with her
wasted fingers, through which the hot tears fell fast as
the rain-drops in the breeze from the shower-bedashed
tree above us&mdash;when the sound of hound and horn
once more swelled in the gale; and first the fox came
over the wall above us, then the whole pack, tumbling
tumultuously one over another down the face of the
rocky precipice, twinkling hither and thither, and
dropping from stone to cliff like the breeze-scattered
foam of a cataract, <i>then one solitary cavalier, who was
dashed, horse and man, to the ground, close to us
where we sat</i>, the rider falling senseless, and the blood
flowing from his mouth and ears.  The gallant horse,
however, struggled to get on his legs again, until he
reached the brink of the old quarry close beneath us,
over which he rolled, dragging the wounded man along
with him by the stirrup, and disappeared, rattling and
rasping among the loose stones and bushes.  Jessy was
roused in an instant; she had caught a glimpse of the
wounded man's face as he was dragged past her, and
giving a loud shriek, as if her heart had split in twain,
dashed herself down the precipice after him, and
vanished for ever from my eyes amongst the furze&mdash;<i>it
was William Adderfang!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The issue of all this complicated misery was the
unfortunate girl being carried home, and that night
prematurely confined of a dead child&mdash;<i>she never saw
the sun rise again</i>.
</p>

<p>
As for the poor Dominie, although his character
was cleared both by Jessy Miller on her death-bed,
and ultimately by Adderfang himself, his heart was
nearly broken; indeed, the blow was heavy enough to
"drive his wits a wee bit ajee," as he phrased it, ever
after.  In this half crazy, half desperate condition, he
suddenly left friends, and house, and home, and
wandered about the country, until his means of subsistence
failing, he enlisted into the militia; and afterwards, as
related by Serjeant Lorimer, into the marines, on the
reduction of the former.
</p>

<p>
Enough and to spare of the Sorrows of Dominie
Skelp; those who desire more must wait until he
publishes them: but the Midge is but a little vessel, and
a heavy episode would swamp her.  So&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here, Mr Peak," struck in Dick Lanyard, who
was standing close beside the small open skylight,&mdash;"clap
on that purchase, and take a small pull of the
main-halyards, before we keep away, do you hear?
Belay all that.  Now, Dogvane, put the helm up&mdash;so.
Let draw the foresheet there."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
And once more the wicked little Midge buzzes along free.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
</h3>

<h4>
GAMBLING&mdash;AN UNLUCKY HIT.
</h4>

<p>
The day wore on without any thing worth relating.
At length I was disturbed by a loud burst of
laughter on deck, and adjourned to the open air.
The first thing that struck me was poor little Dicky
Phantom, a close prisoner in a turkey basket&mdash;a large
wicker cage-looking affair, that we had originally
brought from the frigate with poultry.  He was
crying bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Dogvane, what has the child been doing that
you have imprisoned him in this way?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir," said Mr Weevil, the purser, "it is a
vagary of Lennox's.  The child was certainly nearly
overboard to-day, so, for fear of accidents, he has
chosen to coop him up in this fantastical manner, as
if he had been a turkey."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo&mdash;release him.  Here, Dicky, come out,
will you?"
</p>

<p>
I undid the latch, and the little fellow crept out on
all-fours.  As soon as he was at large, he laid hold
of the cage, and would have thrown it overboard, if I
had not prevented him.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Master Dicky, it is a good idea of
Lennox's; and mind, whenever you are a bad boy, in you
go again."
</p>

<p>
"I was not bad boy," said the urchin; "Lennox'
big mens were bad boy."
</p>

<p>
"How, Dicky, how?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dem shame poor Quacco&mdash;see, see, dere."
</p>

<p>
I looked forward, and noticed Quacco coming on
deck through the fore-hatchway, a very extraordinary-looking
figure certainly.  It seemed that our sable
friend had missed muster twice running; so the men
thought they would fall on a method of curing him;
but before they could put it in force, they had to
imprison poor little Dicky, who was much attached to
the negro, and evinced great grief when they
commenced operations.
</p>

<p>
Their plan was this.  They got some molasses,
and anointed his woolly pate as he slept, and then,
with the cook's dredging-box, they plastered the
same over with flour, and left him in his hammock,
in place of rousing him out to take his morning
watch.  They thus converted his pate into a regular
cockroach trap, for those horrible beetles crowded
from all corners of the 'tween-decks, and settling
down on the molasses and flour, soon got their feet
entangled and their wings besmeared in such a way
that they could not start either tack or sheet, but
were glued in a living web of abomination to the
poor devil's head.  I took Dicky in my arms, and
Quacco toddled aft.  Although I was angry, I could
not help laughing at the figure he cut, with his white
head, like a large cauliflower, bespangled, not with
bees, but with large brown beetles, who were fluttering
with their wings, and shaking their long feelers
or antennae, and struggling to get their legs out of
the bog of treacle and flour; while the poor fellow,
half asleep, was as yet in a great measure unconscious
of his situation.  At this nick, Old Lanyard came on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Who has done this?  I say, men, if you make
a beast of the poor devil in this way again, mind your
hands&mdash;that's all.  Here, cook, take Quacco into the
bows, and let your mate scrub him clean."
</p>

<p>
"Why, we shall have to cut his wool out, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Hair, if you please, Massa Draining," interjected
the culprit himself; "sheep hab wool&mdash;black gentleman
wear hair."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and he should pay the powder tax," said I,
laughing against my will.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Drainings," continued the lieutenant,
"do as you please, but have him cleaned instantly;
his appearance, with those crawling insects amongst
the wool&mdash;hair, I beg pardon&mdash;is shocking; so
forward, Master Quacco, and be scrubbed."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," quoth little Dicky, "forward Massa Quacco,
and be scrub;" and great was the laughter and
shouting at the shearing of Serjeant Quacco.
</p>

<p class="thought">
********
<br />
</p>

<p>
"What is that flying on board the Gazelle, Mr
Peak?" said Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"The signal to chase in the north-west, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Mast-head there," the lookout-man answered;
"do you see any thing in the north-west quarter?'
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," replied the man.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Turn the hands up, Mr Peak, and
make sail."
</p>

<p>
This was accordingly done; and, after having
hauled our wind about an hour, we saw the vessel,
which the frigate had seen so much sooner than us
in consequence of the greater height of her masts.
We chased the whole forenoon; and, as we rose
her, made her out to be a large merchant-ship
under all sail, evidently desirous of avoiding the
pleasure of our society if she could; for, verily, like the
ugly face of many an honest man, our appearance
was far from being the best of us, our rig being
deucedly roguish.
</p>

<p>
By five o'clock in the afternoon we were within
half a mile, when we hoisted our colours and pennant,
and fired a gun to make our friend heave to; but
this she declined to do, and we now guessed that she
was one of the large London traders.  There were,
we could see, a number of people on deck, some of
them apparently passengers.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr Wadding," said Mr Lanyard to the
gunner, "he seems determined to lead us a dance;
we must send the next shot nearer him."
</p>

<p>
The old man was looking through the glass at her.
"If I don't mistake, they are training two guns
aft, sir, there, through the stern-ports; and she must
have a crew of some forty hands, I think, from
those I see on deck.  There are a number of
amphiberous-looking people besides on the poop&mdash;passengers,
I suppose&mdash;busy with muskets, sir.  If he
persists in refusing to let us board him, he will bother us
a little."
</p>

<p>
"That is his look out," said Dick.  "Set every
rag that will draw; pack on her, Mr Marline, and clear
away both guns.  Pipe away the cutter's crew,
boatswain, and see they are properly armed."  Then to
me&mdash;"I say, Benjie, any objections to a lark&mdash;Mr
Marline is going in the boat, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"None in the world&mdash;so here's with you, Master
Marline, my boy."
</p>

<p>
I went below to dress myself, and as I was putting
on my jacket, bang, I heard a gun fired at us.
</p>

<p>
"Call Mr Brail, Lennox," said Mr Lanyard.  "Tell
him the chase has run out two stern chase-guns, and
has just fired at us."
</p>

<p>
I came on deck as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Did the shot come near you, Mr Marline?"
continued Lanyard.
</p>

<p>
"It whistled right over our masthead, sir&mdash;it was
very well aimed."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, haul as close by the wind as you
can, and gain the weather gage if possible.  I want
to creep alongside on his weather quarter."
</p>

<p>
This was done; and seeing that we sailed so much
faster than he did, and that, as we hauled up across
his stern within musket-shot, with both guns pointed
at him, we could rake him if we chose, he did not
venture to fire again.  Presently we were within
hail, and found that it was the Roger Beresford, or
some such name, from London, bound to Antigua.
</p>

<p>
"Heave-to, and I will send a boat on board of you."
</p>

<p>
But although his fight had considerably evaporated,
yet he seemed noways inclined to do this thing, even
after he had been told who we were, and that the
vessel astern was his Majesty's frigate the Gazelle.
He kept his people all at quarters, and I noticed
that his broadside consisted of six twelve-pound
carronades, and a long gun amidships; rather too many
pills for a comfortable dose to so small a hooker as the
Midge, if he should prove obstinate, besides the
absurdity of the thing in being peppered by one
of our own merchant craft, through a vagary of the
master's.
</p>

<p>
As we approached, one of the muskets of the
motley group that were clustered on the poop went off,
apparently from awkwardness or accident, which the
others took for a signal, and four or five were let
drive, but fortunately mighty wide of their mark.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Peak, fire that musket close over the heads
of these heroes."
</p>

<p>
Crack&mdash;the whole bunch bobbed, as if they had
seen the bullet coming; and immediately the gallant
band tumbled down, one over another, on the
quarterdeck, in much admired disorder.  We ranged
close alongside, with the boat towing astern, ready
manned and armed, and all hands at quarters.  This
formidable manoeuvre seemed to quail the courage of
the chase a little.
</p>

<p>
"I shall board you, whether you will or not, my
fine fellow; so round to this instant, or I fire into you."
</p>

<p>
Seeing Lanyard was angry and in earnest, he now
did as desired.  So we were presently on his deck,
when we found he was a running ship, who, not liking
our appearance, had very properly tried to escape in
the first instance, and, finding that impossible, to fight,
if need were, in the second.  All his papers were right,
and I had time to take a squint at the passengers.
There were several ladies on board&mdash;three, I think&mdash;an
elderly one, and two very handsome girls.  They
were now all on deck, surrounded by the male
passengers, the Spartan band who had made such a hostile
demonstration on the poop, some of whom cut rather
conspicuous figures, in their shooting jackets, with
bran-new red turkey leather pocketbooks peeping out
of the numberless pockets, and gay seal-skin caps, and
natty waistcoats, with lots of chains and seals&mdash;every
thing, in fact, of the newest and gaudiest&mdash;and oh for
the murder and piracy of his Majesty's English amongst
the Cockney crew!  One spruce young fellow&mdash;the
youth whose musket had gone off by mistake&mdash;had
chosen to equip himself, sailor fashion, jacket,
trowsers, and white vest, with a straw hat and black ribbon,
and lots of bright brass buttons, all astonishingly fine.
He kept swaggering about the deck, on which, by the
way, he could hardly stand, and twice, rather
unceremoniously, thrust himself between me and one of the
young ladies, to whom I happened to be speaking.  I
determined to give him a fright.  So I tipped the wink
to Marline.
</p>

<p>
"Dogvane, order the boat's crew on deck."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now, captain, have the kindness to muster your
people, if you please."
</p>

<p>
The man remonstrated, but the midshipman insisted;
and presently the poor fellows were ranged on the
lee-side of the quarterdeck, each in momentary dread
of being selected as pressed men.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir," persisted the captain, "I solemnly
protest against this; we carry a letter of marque, sir;
and it is more than your rating is worth to take any of
my hands.  I solemnly protest against such conduct."
</p>

<p>
Marline apparently gave in.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, sir; but we must be manned by hook
or crook, you know, however unwilling to distress
running ships.  Oh, I see&mdash;<i>there</i> is a smart hand, in
the gay jacket there, who does not seem to belong to
your crew&mdash;a good seaman, evidently, by the cut of
his jib."
</p>

<p>
This last part of his speech was intended to be overheard
by the fresh-water sailor with the brass buttons,
who now toddled up&mdash;the vessel was rolling a good
deal&mdash;smirking and smiling&mdash;"Why, captain, I have
paid great attention since we embarked, and really I
have become a very capital sailor, sir.  Do you know
I have been twice through the lubber's hole?"
</p>

<p>
"Really!  I knew you were a thorough good bit
of stuff;" and then in a gruff voice, "so hand up your
bag, sir, and step into the boat."
</p>

<p>
"Hand up my bag, and step into the boat!" said
the poor fellow, all abroad; "my bag! la, sir, my
clothes a'n't packed, and why should I go into your
boat?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply," said Marline, slapping him on the
shoulder with force to make him wince again, "that
you are the very man I want.  Your nautical air and
speech have betrayed you, sir; and I can see with half
an eye that you are second-mate of some vessel; I
therefore press you into the service, to serve his
Majesty on board of his gallant frigate the Gazelle
there"&mdash;pointing to her, as she was fast coming up
astern.
</p>

<p>
He shrank back in great alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Lack-a-daisy, sir, it's all a mistake&mdash;I am no sailor,
sir&mdash;I am Joe Wilkins the draper, son of old Joe
Wilkins, number so-and-so, Coleman Street.  Me a
sailor! my wig!"
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Mr Joseph Wilkins, I begin to think
I may be wrong; but never pass yourself off for a sailor
again, lest worse come of it; and never take firearms
into your hands until you learn how to manage them.
Why, sir," continued Marline sternly, "you were the
cause of five musket shots being fired at us, and the
blood of men who were doing no more than their duty,
sir, might have been spilt by your swaggering."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Joey had gradually crept away towards
the companion, and by this time nothing but his head
was above deck.  I made a sudden spring at him,
when he vanished in a moment, amid a volley of
laughter from all hands.  We now made our bows to
the ladies, apologizing for any little alarm we might
have caused, and bidding the captain good-by, were
speedily at home again.
</p>

<p>
The period was now approaching when we were to
part company, the Gazelle for Jamaica, and the Midge
for Havanna; and on such a day, Lanyard having
received his orders, we altered our course a point or two
to the northward, and lost sight of the commodore
before the night fell.
</p>

<p>
Nothing particular occurred until we arrived within
a couple of days' run of Havanna, when we made out
a sail lying becalmed right a-head.  We carried the
breeze up to within half a mile of her, when it failed
us also; and there we both lay rolling on the
glass-like swell of the great Bahama Channel, one of the
hottest quarters of the globe in a calm that ever I was
in.  The heat was absolutely roasting.  The vessel
we had seen was a brig with bright sides, which, as
we approached, had hoisted a signal of distress at the
mizen peak, the American ensign, with the stars down,
and the stripes uppermost.  A boat was immediately
manned, and pulled towards her, for apparently she
had none of her own.  I went in her&mdash;any thing to
break the tedium of a sea life.  As we neared her,
the crew, some six or eight hands, were seen running
about the deck, and holding out their hands imploringly
towards us, in a way that I could not account
for.  As we came closer, the master hailed in a low
husky voice, "For Heaven's sake send us some water,
sir, we are perishing of thirst&mdash;water, sir, water, for the
love of God!"  We were now alongside, when three
men absolutely <i>tumbled</i> over the brig's side into the
boat, and began, before we could recover our surprise,
to struggle who should first get his lips into the small
puddle of dirty water in the bottom of it.  Brackish
as it must have been, it was drank up in a moment.
The extremity of the poor fellows was evidently great,
so I jumped on deck, and the boat was immediately
sent back for a breaker of water.
</p>

<p>
Sailors have their virtues and vices like other men,
but I am not arrogating for them when I say, that a
scene like this, in all its appalling bearings; that misery,
such as we saw before us, so peculiarly incidental to
his own condition, would, were it from this cause
alone, thrill to a sailor's heart, with a force unknown
and undreamt of by any other human being.  Dogvane,
the old quartermaster, had steered us on board.
He now jumped up in the stern sheets, and cast off his
jacket&mdash;"You, Jabos, you limber villain," said he to
a slight boy who pulled the foremost oar, "come out
of the bow, and take the tiller, will ye? and mind you
steer steady.  Shift forward, my hearties, and give me
the stroke oar."  The boat's crew at this hint tore
their hats off, with a chance of a stroke of the sun
before their eyes, and dashed them to the bottom of the
boat, stripped up their frock sleeves to their armpits,
undid the ribbons that fastened their frock collars,
new-fitted their stretchers, and wetting the palms of
their hands, feathered their oars, and waited for the
word.  "Now mind your strain, my lads," again sung
out old Dogvane, "until the boat gathers way&mdash;no
springing of the ash staves, do you hear?  Give way
now."  The boat started off like an arrow&mdash;the oars
groaned and cheeped, the water buzzed away into a
long snow-white frothy wake, and in <i>no time</i> she was
alongside the felucca, on whose deck, in his red-hot
haste, the quartermaster first toppled down on his nose,
and then, scarcely taking time to touch his hat to Mr
Lanyard, we saw him bundle down the main hatchway;
in another moment a small cask, ready slung, slowly
ascended, and was rolled across the deck into the boat.
But this was not all; the Midges on board the felucca
were instantly all astir, and buzzing about at a devil of
a rate&mdash;out sweeps was the word, and there was the
black hull of the little vessel torn along the shining
surface of the calm sea, right in the wake of the boat,
by twelve long dark sweeps, looking for all the world,
in the distance, like a beetle chasing a common fly
across a polished mirror blazing with intolerable
radiance under the noon-dav sun.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that, first of all, the brig had been a long
time baffled in the Horse latitudes, which ran their
supply of water short; and, latterly, they had lain a whole
week becalmed where we found them.  Several days
before we fell in with them, they had sent away the
boat with three hands to try and reach the shore, and
bring back a supply, but they had never returned,
having in all likelihood either perished from thirst
before they got to land, or missed the brig on their way
back.  No soul on board, neither captain nor crew,
had cooled his parched tongue for eight-and-forty hours
before we boarded them&mdash;<i>this in such a climate</i>!
</p>

<p>
There was not only no water, but not a drop of
liquid unconsumed of any kind or description
whatever, saving and excepting some new rum, which the
men had freely made use of at first, until two of them
died raving mad in consequence.  When I got on
board, the cask was lying open on the tap, and, perishing
as they were, not one of them could swallow a
drop of it if they had tried; they said it was like taking
aquafortis or melted lead into their mouths, when at
any time they were driven, by the fierceness of their
sufferings, to attempt assuaging their thirst with it.  I
had not been five minutes on board, when the captain
seemed to go mad altogether.
</p>

<p>
"My poor wife, sir&mdash;oh, God, she is dying in the
cabin, sir&mdash;she may be dead&mdash;she must be dead&mdash;but
I dare not go below to look at her.&mdash;Oh, as you hope
for mercy at your dying day, hail your people to make
haste, sir&mdash;half an hour may be too late"&mdash;and the
poor fellow dashed himself down on the deck, writhing
about, like a crushed reptile, in a paroxysm of the
most intense agony; while the men, who were all
clustered half-naked in the bows, with wet blankets
on their shoulders, in the hope that nature would in
this way absorb some moisture, and thus alleviate
their sufferings, were peering out with their feverish
and blood-shot eyes, and wan faces, at the felucca;
watching every motion on board with the most
breathless anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"There, there&mdash;there is the cask on deck&mdash;they
are lowering it into the boat&mdash;they have shoved off&mdash;oh,
great God in Heaven, we shall be saved after all!"&mdash;and
the poor fellows raised a faint hurrah, and
closed in on me, some shaking my hands, others
dropping on their knees to bless me; while one poor
creature lay choking on the hard deck in a fit of
hysterical laughter, as if he had been a weakly
woman.
</p>

<p>
The boat could not possibly be back under ten
minutes; so I went below into the cabin, and never
did I behold such a heart-rending sight.  The small
table that had stood in the centre had been removed;
and there, stretched on a coarse wet blanket, lay a
half-naked female&mdash;pale and emaciated&mdash;her long hair
dishevelled, and hanging over her face, and down her
back, in wet clotted strands, with a poor miserable
infant puling and nuzzling at her wasted breast; while
a black woman, herself evidently deep sunk in the
same suffering, was sprinkling salt water from a pail
on the unhappy creature and her child.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, massa," cried the faithful negress&mdash;"oh,
massa, give missis some water, or him dead&mdash;I strong,
can last some time yet&mdash;but poor missis"&mdash;and here
she sobbed, as if her heart would have burst; but the
fountains of her tears were dried up.  The white
female was unable to raise her head&mdash;she lay
moaning on the deck, and mumbling audibly with her dry
and shrunken lips, as if they had been ossified; but
she could not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Keep a good heart, madam," said I&mdash;"we have
sent on board for water&mdash;it will be here in a
minute."  She looked doubtingly at me, clasped her hands
together above her child's head, and seemed to pray.  I
ran on deck&mdash;the boat, in an incredibly short time,
was alongside again, with the perspiration pouring
down the flushed faces and muscular necks of the
kind-hearted fellows in her&mdash;their duck-clothing as
wet and dank as a boat-sail in a race.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Dogvane&mdash;hand up the breaker&mdash;quick,
man, quick."  My request was unnecessary; it was
on deck in an instant; but before I could turn round,
the men of the brig made a rush aft, and seized the
cask, making a vain attempt to carry it forward;
alas! poor fellows, they had not the strength of children.
We easily shoved them aside, as it was necessary they
should not get water-logged by too free a use of it at
first.&mdash;"Now, Dogvane, mind what I tell you&mdash;make
that small tub there full of five-water grog&mdash;no
stronger, mind&mdash;and serve out a pint to each of these
poor fellows, and not a drop more at present."  I
seized a glass of the first of it, and ran below.  "Here,"
said I, to the black servant&mdash;"here, take a mouthful
yourself, and then give some to your mistress."  She
shook her head, and made as if she would have helped
her mistress first; but the selfishness of her own
grinding misery conquered the poor creature's
resolution; and dashing, rather than carrying the glass to
her mouth, she ravenously swallowed the whole contents
in a second, and then fell flat on the deck with
a wild laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, massa, I can't help it&mdash;nobody love missis like
Juba; but once I taste him, I could not help it for de
life-blood of me, massa.  Oh, my eye, my eye like
cinder&mdash;like red-hot bullet dem is, massa&mdash;oh, for one
tear, one leetle tear&mdash;oh, dere come one tear; but
God, God, him is hot more as boiling rum, and
salt&mdash;ah, ah, ah"&mdash;and the poor creature rolled about the
deck in the uttermost distress.
</p>

<p>
The master of the vessel had by this time entered,
and lifted up his wife into a sitting position; and
there she sat, with her parched mouth all agape, the
black fur on her tongue, and with glazed and half-shut
eyes; her pinched features, and death-like complexion
evincing tearfully the strength of her sufferings.
</p>

<p>
He poured some water into her mouth, but she
could not swallow it; he tried again, and from the
gurgling noise in her throat, I thought she was suffocating,
especially as I noticed, as if conscious that she
was departing, she now clutched her poor wasted baby
to her shrunk bosom with all the little strength she
possessed.  But she <i>had</i> swallowed a little, and this
revived her; and after several other trials, the poor
fellow had the happiness to see his wife snatched from
the jaws of death, and able to sit up by herself with
her back against the locker.  She now began to moan
heavily, and to rock herself to and fro over her helpless,
all but dead infant, as it lay, struggling faintly,
and crying with its small imploring voice, on her
knee; at length she acquired sufficient strength to
gasp out, "God bless you, sir&mdash;God bless you&mdash;you
have saved my child, and all of us&mdash;God bless
you,"&mdash;and then resumed her moaning, as if she was
suffering something that she herself could not
describe.  I sent on board for more water, and some
tea and other small luxuries from my private stock;
and that same evening, as the sun was setting,
under a canopy of glorious clouds, beneath which
the calm sea glowed like molten gold, gradually
melting into gorgeous purple, I saw a small dark
ripple ruffling its mirror-like surface in the east,
and gradually steal down towards where we lay.
The next moment I felt a light zephyr-like air on the
palm of my wet hand as I held it up.  Presently,
as the grey cat's-paws became darker, and fluttered
down stronger and nearer to us, and were again
withdrawn, and shifted about, shooting out and
shortening like streamers, Mr Peak sung out, "There,
there's the breeze at last, sir, there;" and the
smooth shining canals that divided the blue shreds
of ripples gradually narrowed, while the latter
increased and came down stronger, until the whole
sea to windward was roughened into small dark waves,
that increased as the night fell, and both the Midge
and brig were buzzing along on their course to
Havanna before a six-knot breeze.
</p>

<p>
The next evening we were under the Moro Castle,
where we anchored.  At daylight on the following
morning we ran in through the narrow entrance,
under the tremendous forts that crown its high banks
on each side, and anchored before this most
magnificent city, this West Indian Liverpool; while its
batteries and bastions, with the grinning cannon
peering through numberless embrasures, the tall spires
and towers, the highest of the houses, the masts and
drying sails of numberless vessels, with their gay
flags, British, American, French, Spanish, and of
almost every country in the world, were glancing
bright and fresh in the early sunbeams, under a
floating canopy of thin blue smoke from the charcoal fires.
All which magnificent description goes for this much:
the unsentimental Dons were doffing their nightcaps,
and donning their breeches, while the fires were
lighting to prepare their coffee and chocolate.
</p>

<p>
That forenoon I went on shore, and delivered my
letters to Mr M&mdash;&mdash;, one of the most extensive
English merchants in the place, a kind and most
hospitable man.  He invited me to dine with him, and
to accept of a bed at his house in the evening, both of
which were too good offers to be sneezed at.  We
had a very large party at dinner, composed of a lot of
Mr M&mdash;&mdash;'s clerks, several masters of merchantmen,
and the captain and two lieutenants of an American
frigate lying there, all three of the latter, by the way,
extremely pleasant men.
</p>

<p>
There was one of Mr M&mdash;&mdash;'s adherents present,
a very odd creature, and rather a wildish one, an
Irishman; what his real name was I forget now, but
he was generally called Listado.  His prime object
during dinner was to quiz the Americans, but they
took it very good-naturedly.  He then tried his hand
on me, in what I believe is vulgarly called trotting,
which is to get one on his hobby, and appear to listen
most anxiously all the while, although every one but
yourself sees you are made to show your paces more
for the amusement of the company than their
information.  At length I saw through the rogue, and
dismounted, laughing heartily at the cleverness with
which he had paraded me.
</p>

<p>
In the evening, the mercantile members of our
party retired to the counting-house, the Americans
returned to their ship, and I strolled about the town
until the night fell, when I returned by appointment
for Listado, with whom I went to the opera, which
far surpassed any thing I expected to see or hear in
that quarter of the world.  After it was over, we
adjourned to some lodging-house or tavern in the
neighbourhood, and perpetrated the heinous sin of
eating a heavy supper, for which I paid afterwards, as
will be seen.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that the aforesaid Monsieur Listado
had given up his bed to me, and slept himself on a
small pallet beside the wall in the same room.  At
the right hand of the head of my bed, a lofty door
opened into an adjoining room, a large dreary
unfurnished apartment, with several packages of goods
scattered about on the floor.  On examination, I
found there was no window in it, nor any light
admitted except through the door into our room, which
was the only opening into it.  It was a regular <i>cul de sac</i>.
</p>

<p>
We must have been some hours asleep when I
awoke, or thought I did, pretty much the same thing
so far as my feelings at the moment went, lying on my
back, with my hands crossed on my breast, like the
statue of a knight templar.  These said paws of mine
seemed by the way to be of an inconceivable weight,
as if they had actually been petrified, and to press so
heavily on my chest as to impede my breathing.
Suddenly one of my little fingers grew, like Jonah's
gourd, to a devil of a size; and next moment the
thumb of the other hand, as if determined not to be
outdone by the minikin on the left, became a
facsimile of a Bologna sausage; so there I lay like
a large lobster, with two tremendous claws.  My
nose then took its turn, and straightway was
converted into one of Mr M&mdash;&mdash;'s cotton bags, that lay
in the store below, containing three hundred-weight,
more or less.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said I now to myself, "what a fool I have
been!  Nightmare&mdash;nightmare."
</p>

<p>
"Hookey, but it isn't though," said Listado.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," said I to myself again&mdash;for I was quite
certain I had not spoken&mdash;"how the deuce can
Listado answer my <i>thoughts</i>, which I have never
uttered?"&mdash;And I tried to ask him, but my nose, or the
cotton bag, would not let me speak.  "Why, it must
be nightmare," again thought I to myself.
</p>

<p>
"The devil a nightmare is it," again said Listado.
</p>

<p>
And I now began to take fright in earnest; when,
on the opposite wall, for I could only see in the
direction of the foot of my bed, a gradually increasing
gleam of pale glow-worm-coloured light fell; streaming
apparently through the door that opened at my
shoulder into the large lumber-room already described.
</p>

<p>
The light seemed to proceed from the further end of
this apartment, because the shadow of one of the boxes
of goods that lay scattered about the floor was cast
strongly against the wall of my room at the foot of
the bed.
</p>

<p>
"What can this mean?" for I knew from actual
survey the geography of the apartment from whence
the glare proceeded; "what can this mean?  Some
trick of Listado's.  Snapdragon, snapdragon."
</p>

<p>
"Snapdragon be d&mdash;d simply," quoth Listado's
voice once more.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday," quoth I.
</p>

<p>
But there he lay, full in the stream of light,
apparently sound asleep; and so transmogrified under its
baleful influence, that he looked more like a corpse
than a living man.
</p>

<p>
"Murder! what comes next?" groaned I&mdash;for I
could now speak&mdash;as the shadow of the figure of the
poor woman rescued from perishing with thirst on
board of the American brig glided along the wall with
her infant in her arms and her clothes in disorder, the
wet blanket which the poor negro had been moistening,
when I first saw her, hanging from her shoulders,
and her hair dishevelled; her figure, in fact, in every
point precisely as I had seen her in the cabin.  The
apparition seemed to pause for a moment, and then
stepped towards the box of dry goods, and setting
itself down, began to rock itself and moan; and the poor
picaniny began to struggle and pule at its mother's
bosom for all the world as naturally as it had done in
the brig.
</p>

<p>
"There's a phantasmagoria for you, Master
Benjie;&mdash;free gratis for nothing, Master Benjie," said I
to myself; whereupon my thumb, of the size of the
Bologna sausage, took my nose, of the size of the
cotton bag, such a crack!  I thought it was knocked off.
Presently I felt as if the latter had been set a-bleeding
so furiously as to float the bed off the floor, and
me in it.  By and by the room became filled with
blood; and there I lay, cruising about in the floating
bed, until the door gave way, when the crimson
torrent rushed down stairs like the rapids of Niagara,
bursting into the other sleeping apartments in its
descent&mdash;I could hear the suffocating coughs of
the inmates as they were drowning.  At length, the
blood having had vent, the bed once more subsided,
and took the ground on the very spot from whence it
had originally been floated.  The light on the wall,
however, was still as strong as ever, but had changed from
the moonlight tinge to a hot, deep red glare, such as
the devils break out of rocks with in theatres.
</p>

<p>
The shadow of the box had disappeared, and so had
the figure of the poor woman and her child; but I
now heard a noise as of some one singing snatches of
the Carnival of Venice to himself, and dancing as if
practising a new step, with occasionally a tap tap on
the floor, as if the performer had been the owner of a
wooden leg.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, my lad," thought I; "why, what
next, what next?"&mdash;on which the figure of a man,
dressed in the old-fashioned coat commonly worn by
physicians in Havanna, with frills at his wrists, and
tight inexpressibles on, glided across the wall and
disappeared.  Presently I was conscious he was in the
room, which became suddenly hot and choky, and, in
fact, standing at my bedside, for I could hear some one
breathe, although I had not the power of turning my
neck to look at him.
</p>

<p>
"Have the kindness," said he, in some unknown
tongue, but which was quite intelligible to
me&mdash;"have the kindness to let me feel your
pulse."  Scarcely knowing what I did, I held out my hand.
"Your nose, if you please," quoth the physician;
on which he took it, big as it was, between his finger
and thumb, and gave it such a squeeze, that it burst
with a noise like thunder, and instantly relapsed into
its former shape.  At the report, I could hear the
sentries on the walls a mile off, hailing&mdash;"quien viva,
quien viva," along the whole line.  The figure now
came forward, so that I could see him.  He was a tall
and very handsome man, but his complexion, pale and
ashy, had the self-radiant appearance of steel at a
white heat; indeed the glow of his face was like to
roast my skin into parchment.  His features were
good, but there was rather a peculiar cast in his eye.
He wore a black silk cowl, which stuck out a little
over his ears on each side, as if two small horns had
been concealed under it; and he was dressed in deep
black.  One leg was symmetry itself, but the other
was shaped like that of a satyr, and ended in a hoof;
however, the shank was covered with a silk stocking,
and the hoof by a curiously-shaped shoe, made by
Hoby to fit with wonderful neatness.
</p>

<p>
"You will do very well now," said he, "so I will
see how Mr Listado comes on;" and, as he turned to
where he lay, I saw a small barbed tail, glowing like
red-hot iron, protruding from between the voluminous
skirts of his coat, that corruscated, and sent sparks all
about the room.  It kept twisting about like a live
eel, and jerking in a fidgety manner; and I was
puzzling myself how it did not burn the cloth of his skirts,
when my attention was fixed on what the figure was
doing.  Listado was still sound asleep; there was a
basin of water on a chair close to his head;&mdash;the figure
dipped the end of the tail into it, when it instantly
began to boil furiously, so that the spray of the bubbles,
as they frothed and poppled about, burnt Listado's face,
and he awoke.
</p>

<p>
"Who has scalded me in this way?" quoth he.
</p>

<p>
"Only have patience, my dear sir," said the
physician; "it is all meant kindly,&mdash;merely to season
you; merely to season you."
</p>

<p>
"Season me&mdash;season me to what, d&mdash;n me"&mdash;quoth
Listado in a fury.
</p>

<p>
"With all the pleasure in life, my dear sir," said
the figure, nipping off the tail of Listado's exclamation
as if it had been a leech in the hands of my friend
Majendie; "I will do any thing to oblige you, and
d&mdash;d you shall be with all the comfort in life; only
wait a moment;"&mdash;and he thereupon took a small
very natty toasting fork out of his coat pocket; but,
in the act, burnt his fingers against his red-hot tail.
"Curse the tail," quoth he, as he pulled out the
joints of the fork, until it was about a yard long.  All
this while Listado, blasted by the deep red glare into
a dark crimson, lay like a big lobster newly boiled,
looking at the physician's preparations, apparently
fascinated, and without the power of motion.  The figure
now looked at me over his shoulder, and winked
knowingly, when some vapour, like an escape from
the safety-valve of a steam-boiler, puffed out of his
mouth; but he apologized, and said, he had been
smoking, although the flavour had more of
brimstone than tobacco in it.  "Good by, Mr Brail;
I will come for <i>you</i> by and by."&mdash;"You need not
hurry, my dear fellow," thought I;&mdash;and so saying,
he, with all the coolness in life, clapped the fork
into Listado's stern-frame, and, begging pardon for the
trouble he was putting him to, lifted him, writhing
like an impaled frog, on the instrument, and as
if he really had been no heavier.  He then calmly
walked right through the solid wall with him, as if it
had been a cloud, and disappeared.  I could hear
Listado roaring lustily all the while, and the physician
making numberless apologies, always concluding with
"I shall be as gentle with you, Mr Listado, as your
request to be d&mdash;d will permit."
</p>

<p>
At last the sounds died away, and I began to think
of going to sleep; when an instrument that I at once
knew to be our friend the physician's fork was thrust
into me from below, through the mattrass.  "Hillo,
hillo, hillo," roared I; "this will never do, by"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What the devil do you grunt and growl so much
in your sleep for?" shouted Listado.
</p>

<p>
"Devil!" quoth I, rubbing my eyes; "oh! confound
the poached eggs."
</p>

<p>
About a fortnight after this, Listado and I, along
with one of the young American officers, looked in at
a monte-table and staked our doubloon a-piece; both
of my friends lost, but I was most unaccountably
fortunate; for, without knowing any thing of the game,
or the chances of it, I found, when I rose to go away,
that I had no less than fifty doubloons in my fob.  As
we left the house I noticed a stout, dark-complexioned
young man, with great whiskers, dressed, like most of
the others present, in a light gingham coat and white
trowsers, but without either waistcoat or neckcloth,
eye me very fiercely.  He had been one of the
heaviest sufferers by my winnings; and when I rose, he
followed me.  I thought nothing of this at the time,
and walked on with the American and Listado, who
had agreed to adjourn to a tavern to sup together; but
I had had enough of suppers for some time, and
therefore parted with them at the street corner, and bore
up alone for Mr M&mdash;&mdash;'s.
</p>

<p>
It was by this time near twelve o'clock at night,
very dark and gusty; and as I proceeded, the rain
splashed in my face, and there were several flashes of
lightning, followed by loud claps of thunder.  By one
of the former I thought I saw the person from whom I
had won so much, skulking behind a pillar that
formed part of a colonnade in front of one of the public
buildings; and I will not conceal that an uneasy
feeling arose in my mind, as I recalled the numberless
stories of Spanish vindictiveness to my recollection.
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo," said I to myself, ashamed of my
weakness&mdash;"all romance, all romance."  As I spoke, I
was nearly blinded by a flash of lightning, and clapt
my hand to my eyes, "Ah&mdash;what is that?" I
exclaimed, as I received a blow under my fifth rib, on
the right side, that made me stagger to the wall.
Another flash showed me the figure of the man,
gliding rapidly away into the darkness.  I put my
hand to my side, and felt the blood streaming down.
I had been wounded, and was becoming faint, faint.
I tried to proceed, but could only stagger against a
pillar, to which I clung.  I could no longer breathe&mdash;every
thing swam around me, and I became deadly
cold.  "I am gone!" I gasped out, as I sank on my
knees, and leant my head against the wall.  "Oh
God, forgive my sins, and receive my soul&mdash;My
mother&mdash;bless my poor mother!"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
When my recollection returned, I was lying on a
low bed, or <i>quatre</i>, without curtains or canopy of any
kind, in the middle of a very large and lofty room.
It was greatly darkened, but I could perceive, from
the bright pensiles of light that streamed through the
crevices of the closed shutters, that it was broad day.
For some time, as my consciousness gradually awoke,
I lay watching the motes dancing and revolving in
the sunbeams, and then looked up towards the bare
timbers of the floor above me.  "Where <i>can</i> I be&mdash;and
what <i>has</i> happened?" I murmured to myself.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said a low female voice close to me&mdash;"hush!
Doctor Delaville says you are not to speak,
sir,&mdash;not even to turn, if you can help it."
</p>

<p>
"Doctor Delaville&mdash;not speak!  Call Lennox, will
ye?" and I again began to waver.&mdash;"Mr Marline,
how is her head?  Oh, my side&mdash;merciful
Providence! what has befallen&mdash;what <i>is</i> wrong with
me?"&mdash;as I tried to move round in order to see the person
who had spoken.  I effected my purpose so far as to
half turn my face from the light&mdash;"Oh, Heaven have
mercy on me!&mdash;my senses are gone, and I am mad."  I
shut my eyes, and under this heart-crushing belief,
wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
There was a large balcony or open window in the
wall of the apartment farthest from the street, towards
which I had turned my face, that opened into a room
beyond, at a height of about three feet from the floor.
It was fitted with shutters opening inwards, like those
of the external windows.  The saloon into which I
looked was apparently a lofty room, and lighted, so
far as I could judge, entirely from the roof.  I also
inferred that this part of the house projected back
from the main building, and that it was lower, and
overshadowed by green trees; for the light that shone
from above was subdued, and green, and cold, and
more like moonlight than that of the sun.  On the
walls beyond I could see pictures; and a piano stood
near the window, and several sofas were scattered
about, so that it appeared better furnished than most
houses I had seen in the place; and I knew, that
although I was certainly not in Mr M&mdash;&mdash;'s house,
neither was I in that of a Spaniard.  There was a
very handsome geranium, in an ornamented porcelain
jar, in the window, which, in some measure, impeded
my view at the top; although near the sill there was
only the solitary stalk, naked of leaves.  Presently,
as my eyes got accustomed to the twilight, I noticed
gloves, and bonnets, and several large green fans,
lying on a table beyond the window, as if this had
been the retreat of some of the females of the family;
all continued as still as death&mdash;and the coolness and
freshness of the apartment I looked into, was grateful
beyond belief to my feverish eye and swimming
brain.  By and by I heard a rattling and creaking
volante drive past, and the shouts of the driver to his
mule, which excited me; and I once more asked the
person who was sitting knitting beside me, where I
was.  "Hush, hush&mdash;until the doctor comes," was
still the answer,&mdash;and I again turned my eyes in the
direction of the balcony, and gloated on the flowers
and leaves of the noble plant on the window-sill,
which seemed jet black, as they twinkled in the
breeze between me and the light.  I could now hear
the sea-breeze set in, and rush amongst the branches of
the trees, and moan through the long galleries and
lofty apartments of the house&mdash;slamming a shutter
to here, and making a door bang there, and rustling
the shawls, and bonnets, and female gear in the
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
The effect of this on my shattered nerves was
delightful; and, for the first time since I had
recovered my recollection, I lay back with my heart full
of gratitude to the Almighty for his mercy towards
me.  I now remembered that I had been wounded,
and began to piece together in my mind the transactions
at the gaming-table, and the various circumstances
that had preceded my sallying forth, and wondering
who had been the good Samaritan who had
poured oil and wine into my wounds.  I again looked
earnestly round.  "There&mdash;what do I see&mdash;<i>who</i> is
that&mdash;<i>what</i> is that?  Oh, I am mad&mdash;I am mad&mdash;and
all this is a dream."  I looked again.  The soft
mysterious light already mentioned now floated over the
figure of a tall and very handsome young man, dressed
with great simplicity&mdash;a bluejacket, red striped shirt,
open at the collar, with his loose black neckerchief
untied, the ends hanging down on his bosom, and
white trowsers.  He was seated at an easel in the
boudoir, under the geranium, and close to the
window, with his profile towards me, a palette and
paint-brush in one hand, while with a finger of the other
he seemed to be in the act of tracing a line on the
canvass before him.  His complexion was very dark
and sunburnt, his mouth and nose beautifully formed,
and his forehead, on which the cold light from above
was cast clear and strong, was very high and pale,
contrasting finely with the bronzing of his lower
features; his hair especially caught my attention&mdash;it
was black, glossy, and curling.  "Great God! is it
<i>him</i>, or his disembodied spirit?"
</p>

<p>
A young female, who until this moment I had
scarcely noticed, stood behind his chair, and bent over
him, looking also earnestly at the half-finished
painting on the easel;&mdash;a tall and light-formed girl, very
pale, and wearing her hair dressed high on her head
without any ornament whatever; she was habited in
a plain white frock, low cut at the bosom, with a
pale green band round her waist, and had one of her
beautifully-rounded arms extended over his shoulder,
while the other rested on the back of his chair, as,
with lips apart, she pointed to some particular part of
the painting.
</p>

<p>
Both continued so perfectly immovable that I could
not even discern his breathing, nor the heaving of
her lovely bosom.  "Were they beings of this world?&mdash;was
it him in very truth?" At this moment the
leaves of the trees above were agitated by the passing
breeze, for small twittering shadows were suddenly
cast on the faces and figures of the group, so as to
alter the expression of the former in a startling way,
making them flit and gibber, as it were.  I thought
some horrid change was coming o'er the spirit of my
dream, as I exclaimed,&mdash;"Oh, no, no!&mdash;he is gone,
poor fellow&mdash;gone&mdash;cold at the bottom of the
sea&mdash;and I am mad&mdash;Oh God, I am a lunatic!"  And I
once more shut my eyes and wept, until I thought
my very heart would have burst in twain; but they
were blessed tears, for they revived me, and my soul
felt lighter as I again thanked Heaven for my
deliverance, and tried to convince myself that all I had
seen was but the phantoms of my weakness.  A
minute might have fled before I looked up again, but
the lovely delusion was gone, as the servant or nurse
who was attending me, perceiving me so excited by
what I had seen in the other apartment, had risen
and closed the window-blinds; thus shutting out
every thing in the room beyond from my view.
</p>

<p>
The doctor now arrived, and, sliding up to my
bedside, made his enquiries as to how I felt, and was
greatly pleased with my amendment.  "This will be
great joy to all of them, sir," said he, in broken
English; "so, Mrs Gerard, give your patient his draught,
and after the sleep I hope it will procure"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I interrupted him.  "Pray, doctor, how long have
I been ill?&mdash;and how is all going on in the little
Midge?&mdash;and in whose house am I?&mdash;and who were
the young lady and gentleman that I saw?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "Why, Mr Brail, you have fired off
one whole broadside of questions at me; but rest
satisfied&mdash;all is right on board of de leetle vessel; and
you are in my friend Mr Duquesné's house, who (if
you will only take my advice, and try and obtain some
rest, for you have not slept since you were wounded
a week ago) will have the pleasure of paying his
respects to you&mdash;and Miss Helen Hudson, too,
longs&mdash;&mdash;But I declare I am forgetting my own
instructions&mdash;so not vone oder vord, monsieur,&mdash;not vone
vord&mdash;Adieu until de afternoon."  And he vanished
out of the room in the same noiseless cat-like way
he had entered it.
</p>

<p>
To obtain any information from the nurse that sat
beside me, I knew was out of the question; so I took
the medicine, and soon fell into a balmy sleep.
